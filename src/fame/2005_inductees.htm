                                            The Buddy LaRosa high school Sports Hall of Fame was established
                                            in 1975 to recognize outstanding athletes from area high schools.
                                            Each year, nominees are considered based solely upon high school
                                            accomplishments. Collegiate, professional, or other amateur achievements
                                            have no bearing on the selection process. The nominee must have
                                            graduated high school 10 years before eligibility may begin.

                                                In just two short years of varsity basketball (split between
                                                Garfield and the merger of with Taft in 1980), Stokes scored
                                                almost at will and swatted away shots with intimidating force.
                                                Greg wound up with a career 925 points. He set a school record

                                                Stokes was named Ohio's High School Class AAA Player of the
                                                Year by both the Associated Press and United Press International
                                                and was selected as a Parade Magazine All-American. In 26
                                                games as a senior, Greg scored 635 points, averaged 24.4,

                                                and had 148 blocked shots. He had his uniform No. 41 retired

                                                his 20.4 average was best in the NCAA tournament. Stokes
                                                still holds Iowa's record for a perfect 11-for-11 scoring

                                                graduated in 1985, he was Iowa's all-time leader in scoring,

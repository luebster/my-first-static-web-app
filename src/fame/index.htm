																								<p>In the storied annals for Highlands High School football, the coaches
																									read like a “Who’s Who” in Northern Kentucky sports. Dale Mueller may
																									well be the best of those who helmed the Highlands Bluebirds.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									In 20 seasons at Highlands, Mueller posted a 250-36 won-loss record
																									and led Highlands High School’s football teams to 11 state
																									championships with four runners-up. Under Mueller’s leadership,
																									Highlands ended its seasons ranked nationally eight times, finishing
																									as high as third in the USA Today Prep Poll in 2009.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									Mueller also coached six seasons at Withrow High School (48-12) and
																									three seasons at Sycamore High School (11-19). Overall, he has
																									compiled a 309-67 record during his 29-year career.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									He was recognized with numerous awards over his career including –
																									Louisville Courier-Journal Kentucky Coach of the Year, Cincinnati
																									Bengals Coach of the Year, Marvin Lewis Coach of the Year, Paul Brown
																									Excellence in Coaching Award, Russell Athletic National Coach of the
																									Year and National Federation of High Schools National Coach of the
																									Year. He was inducted into the Kentucky High School Athletic
																									Association Hall of Fame in 2022.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									“My biggest hope is that the players had an enjoyable experience and
																									that playing football had a positive impact on their lives,” Mueller
																									said.
																									A Highlands graduate in 1973, Mueller was a two-sport athlete and team
																									captain for the baseball and football teams. He earned a total of
																									seven varsity letters and was named all-state his senior year in both
																									sports.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									Upon graduation, he attended Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) and was a
																									three-year catcher on the baseball team. He earned his degree in
																									secondary education at Xavier University.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									Currently, Mueller lives in Fort Thomas, with his wife, Patty. They
																									have four adult children and 10 grandchildren.

																								<p>To the best of his recollection, the first time Dennis Janson ever
																									spoke into a microphone was during his senior year at Elder High
																									School in 1968. He had a part-time job answering the request line at
																									WSAI-AM radio and somehow Elder Athletic Director Fr. Edward
																									Rudemiller thought that qualified him to make Friday final period
																									announcements over the PA system. Little did anyone suspect those
																									2-minute, end-of-week sports schedule bulletins would lead to a nearly
																									50-year broadcasting career that embraced seven radio stations, four
																									television affiliates, three cable networks and now two Halls of Fame.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									DJ sees himself as an unlikely addition to the LaRosa's roster of
																									honorees, having never distinguished himself as an athlete. He did
																									though gravitate to where the action was and often that involved
																									sports.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									As an equipment manager for UC football teams of the early 70s, he was
																									witness to the greatness of Bearcats like Greg Cook, Jim O'Brien and
																									Bobby Bell and led to an association with Paul Brown and his fledgling
																									Cincinnati Bengals, who called Nippert Stadium home their first two
																									years of existence.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									It was while at UC that he migrated to WKRC-AM and WKRC-TV as a
																									weekend radio news anchor, Channel 12 production assistant, fill-in
																									weather man, entertainment editor and eventually sports director as
																									part of the legendary Nick Clooney, Ira Joe Fisher Eyewitness News
																									team of the early 1980s.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									His high school-spawned sports pursuits came full circle when he was
																									enlisted to join the LaRosa's High School Hall of Fame selection
																									committee. That role expanded to include serving as master of
																									ceremonies for the induction banquet, a position he relished for 27
																									years, even as he wrapped up a 28-year stint as sports anchor for
																									WCPO-TV.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									Dennis becomes just the third media member to be so honored, joining
																									the late Joe Quinn of newspaper fame and DJ’s long-time Channel 9
																									collaborator and colleague, John Popovich, as inductees.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									He counts a regional Emmy, the George Ballou award presented by
																									Western Hills Country Club for meritorious contributions to sports and
																									induction to the University of Cincinnati Journalism Hall of Fame
																									among his proudest professional citations, exceeded only by inclusion
																									in what he terms the Gold Standard of Cincinnati sports commendations,
																									the LaRosas's High School Hall of Fame.

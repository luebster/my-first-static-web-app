																								<p>Of all the great Elder football teams, the 1954 Panthers' team is the
																									only team in school history to go unbeaten and untied throughout an
																									entire season, but they didn't win a state championship because there
																									were no state playoffs then. The state champion was decided by the
																									writers who voted in the Associated Press poll, which was skewed
																									toward northern Ohio teams such as Massillon, which was ranked No. 1
																									at the end of the season, followed by Alliance, Canton McKinley,
																									Mansfield Senior and Cleveland Cathedral Latin. Elder finished 10th.
																								</p>
																								<p>Coached by Virgil Scardina, Elder finished 10-0, outscored its
																									opponents, 319-65, and set school records for rushing yardage (2,721
																									yards) and rushing touchdowns (39). The Panthers were led by
																									quarterback 1980 LaRosa's Hall of Famer Dick Selcer, who went on to
																									play at Notre Dame and later fashioned a coaching career that saw him
																									become the head coach at Xavier University. He later worked as the
																									linebackers coach for four NFL teams, including the Bengals. Elder
																									used the Split-T offense, which Selcer ran to near perfection. </p>
																								<p>The Panthers weren't a physically imposing team. After center 2014
																									LaRosa's Hall of Famer Danny James, who checked in at 245 pounds,
																									there was no one else over 200. What they lacked in size they made up
																									for in quickness, especially from halfback Paul Kelly, who led the
																									team with 12 touchdowns and 75 points. The Elder defense posted three
																									shutouts, intercepted 14 passes and recovered 17 fumbles. Selcer,
																									James and tackle Dick Royer all received all-state recognition. Selcer
																									and Royer went on to play at Notre Dame, James played at Ohio State
																									and later for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Chicago Bears in the NFL.
																								</p>
																								<p>End Joe Schaffer was a three-year starter at defensive tackle for
																									Tennessee and played briefly for the Buffalo Bills. Kelly, deemed too
																									small to play college football, played baseball at Ohio State. The
																									late Tom Ballaban, a coaching legend in his own right, once called the
																									1954 Elder team, "the greatest high school team I've ever seen
																									developed in Cincinnati."</p>

																								<p>Having been denied the Ohio Division I state title in two of the
																									previous three seasons, the 1999-2000 Mason girls put an emphatic
																									exclamation point on the ending of the careers of senior starters
																									Racquel Ellis, Susan Lippert and Beth Jones. It didn't hurt that the
																									Comets featured one of the greatest female basketball players in
																									Greater Cincinnati history in Michelle Munoz, who has just been named
																									winner of her first of two consecutive Ohio Ms. Basketball awards.</p>
																								<p>The Comets had lost the previous year in the state championship game
																									to Pickerington, ending the 1998-99 season with a 26-1 record. As the
																									state tournament unwound, a rematch in the Division I state title
																									loomed and this time Mason, led by Munoz's 18 points and five rebounds
																									downed Pickerington, 36-25.</p>
																								<p>Munoz, a LaRosa's MVP and Hall of Famer, went on to win numerous
																									awards including twice named the Ohio Division I Player of the Year, a
																									Parade Magazine High School All-American and Wendy's and USA TODAY
																									High School All-American and Gatorade's Ohio Player of the Year. All
																									five starters on coach Gerry Lackey's squad earned Division I
																									scholarships including Munoz (Tennessee), Jones (Purdue), Ellis
																									(Kentucky), Lippert (Emory) and Jere Issenmann (Illinois).</p>

																									throughout her career. Tara wound up at Highlands' No. 2 all-time
																									Scoring Leader with 2,286 career points behind another LaRosa's Hall
																									of Famer in the legendary Jaime Walz. Boothe also finished third
																									all-time in rebounding. As a senior, she led the state of Kentucky in

																									rebounding (13.4) and was in the top 10 in Field Goal Percentage
																									(56.3%). She is one of only two female athletes to have her jersey
																									retired at Highlands High School.</p>
																								<p>Her high school awards and honors are numerous. Tara Boothe was
																									nominated as a McDonald's All-American and finished as Honorable
																									Mention All-American by Street & Smith. Selected to play in the
																									prestigious Kentucky-Indiana All-Star Games, she went on to be named
																									the Most Valuable Player in both the Kentucky-Ohio All-Star Game and
																									the Kentucky Preps Classic. She was named First Team All-Northern
																									Kentucky by both <i>The Kentucky Post</i> and <i>The Kentucky
																										Enquirer</i>. She was a First Team All-State pick by both the
																									<i>Lexington Herald-Leader</i> and the <i>Louisville
																										Courier-Journal</i>. Boothe was three-time HM All-State by the
																									Associated Press and was named as the Division II Player of the Year
																									by the Kentucky Coaches Association.
																								</p>
																								<p>She carried that scoring prowess on to the next level at Xavier
																									University where she concluded a four-year career as the Lady
																									Musketeers' All-time Leading Scorer with 2,324 points. Among other XU
																									records, she still ranks No. 1 in Single-Season Scoring with 659
																									points, and Single-Season Scoring Average with 21.5 points. She holds
																									the Career Free Throws Made (490) and Free Throws Attempts (661). She
																									ranks No. 3 all-time in Career Rebounds (1,004).</p>
																								<p>Tara Boothe was named the 2006 Greater Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky
																									Women's Sports Association's College Sportswoman of the Year. She
																									played professionally in 2006-07 in Switzerland's Elite League for BC
																									Beuchatel, winning the Swiss championship where she led the team in
																									scoring and rebounding. She was named the league MVP that year.
																									Currently, she lives in Burlington, KY with her husband, Steve and

																								<p>St. Xavier's swimming dynasty has always had their star swimmers, and
																									Pete Carothers certainly fits that description during his high school
																									career. As the Aquabombers were posting four-straight state
																									championships, Carothers contributed nine state titles (four
																									individual, five relays) of his own during that stretch as well as
																									being named an 18-time All-American. He was a three-time Division I
																									100-yard Butterfly state champion, positing a career-best 48.29 as a
																									senior. He also won the 100-Yard Freestyle (45.71) in 2004. He was an
																									integral part of five state championship relay teams, including the
																									200-yard Medley Relay team as a senior. </p>
																								<p>Featured in Sports Illustrated's “Faces in the Crowd”, Carothers was
																									twice named both the Ohio Swimmer of the Year and <i>The Cincinnati
																										Enquirer's</i> Swimmer of the Year. An Olympic Trials qualifier,
																									Carothers represented the United States National Junior Team in
																									Brisbane, Australia. He went on to swim collegiately at Stanford
																									University, where he placed fifth in PAC-10 200-Meter Butterfly
																									(1:45.77), which ranked in the top 15 in school history. He was also
																									an Olympics Trial qualifier as a collegian.</p>
																								<p>Upon graduating from Stanford, Carothers served as Captain in the
																									United State Marine Corps and served two deployments in Afghanistan
																									where he was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with
																									combat distinguished service. He went to Harvard Business School.
																									Currently, he and his wife, Gretchen, live in Huntsville, AL where
																									they have two children – Madge and MIller. Carothers is president of a
																									Eurofins Scientific clinical testing laboratory in Huntsville. </p>

																								<p>Three-sport stars may be rarer recently than in the past, but Jason
																									Druso mastered three sports – but not quite the combination you would
																									think!</p>
																								<p>An outstanding football and baseball star, Druso added swimming
																									during the winter months and he was such a talented athlete that he
																									performed at the state championship level in two of those. Overall, he
																									earned nine varsity letters during his prep career (3 in football, 4
																									in swimming and 2 in baseball) – and earned another rare distinction
																									in being inducted into the Anderson football AND swimming Halls of
																									Fame!</p>
																								<p>Druso captured a state championship medal in swimming when he won the
																									100-yard breaststroke in 58.85. He actually posted a career-best 57.60
																									time – No. 16 in the nation and No. 6 in his age group – as a junior
																									when he finished state runner up. His senior year time may have been
																									even better if not for a football injury! Druso was selected both
																									All-State and All-American in swimming. Football, however, was Druso's
																									best sport. As a senior in 1992, he was named the Ohio Division I
																									Co-Back of the Year with another LaRosa's Hall of Famer in St.
																									Xavier's Scott Sollmann. Druso rushed for 1,759 yards, collected 2,121
																									All-Purpose Yards and scored 29 touchdowns. A First Team All-City
																									selection by The Cincinnati Enquirer, he was also the Southwest Ohio
																									Division I Co-Back of the Year. In his three-year varsity career,
																									Druso rushed for 2,628 yards on 348 carries (7.6 average) and scored
																									43 touchdowns. He compiled 3,567 All-Purpose yards. As a baseball
																									player, he led Anderson in hitting two straight seasons.</p>
																								<p>Druso went on to Miami University and played football for the
																									Redhawks, where he starred on defense at strong safety and was the
																									nickelback player. Miami finished second in the Mid-American
																									Conference in his junior and senior season. He played his senior
																									season with a broken hand and still was one of the team's leading
																									tacklers with two interceptions. Currently, Druso lives in Valparaiso,
																									IN with his wife, Katie, and four children – Ryder, Asher, Piper and
																									Poppy. He is Vice President of Food and Beverage with White Lodging,
																									one of the nation's leading hospitality companies.</p>

																								<p>Before his junior year at St. Xavier High School, the football
																									coaches decided to move Luke Kuechly from tight end to linebacker. It
																									proved to be one of the most significant decisions for both St. Xavier
																									and Luke Kuechly – as he has gone on to become, arguably, the greatest
																									football player to come out of Greater Cincinnati this century. The
																									Bombers went on to become Ohio Division I state champions in 2007,
																									while Kuechly went on to earn the first of what has become an amazing
																									list of football accomplishments that may well lead him to the
																									National Football League Hall of Fame.</p>
																								<p>A two-time All-Greater Cincinnati League selection, Kuechly racked up
																									277 tackles, seven sacks, five forced fumbles, five fumble recoveries,
																									three interceptions and one touchdown in his final two seasons at St.
																									X. Kuechly signed with Boston College, where his reputation for a
																									ferocious style of play earned him every major award in the nation. In
																									three seasons, Kuechly set the BC and Atlantic Coast Conference career
																									tackle records with 532 tackles – just 13 short of the NCAA FBS
																									record. In 2011, he won the Butkus Award, the Lombardi Award, the Lott
																									IMPACT Trophy and the Bronko Nagurski Trophy. He was a two-time
																									Consensus All-American and three-time first-team All-American. He was
																									ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year and ACC Defensive Player of the Year.
																									As a sophomore, he led the nation in tackles (183 – 110 solos) AND as
																									a junior (191 – 102 solo).</p>
																								<p>Kuechly was the No. 9 pick in the 2012 NFL Draft by the Carolina
																									Panthers. He was named NFL Rookie of the Year (2012) and then named
																									NFL Defensive Player of the Year (2013) – joining NFL Hall of Famer
																									Lawrence Taylor as the only other player to do that. He has been a
																									Pro-Bowl selection 7 times and a five-time First Team All-Pro pick. He
																									retired after 8 seasons in the NFL. Currently, Luke Kuechly lives in
																									Charlotte, N.C.</p>

																								<p>As a football star on Elder's Division I state runners-up team
																									(2008), Orlando was named the Greater Cincinnati League Defensive
																									Lineman of the Year in 2008. He was picked First Team All-City and
																									All-Southwest Ohio and earned Special Mention All-Ohio in Division I.
																									But it was on the wrestling mat, where Scales was in a league of his
																									own. Competing in the 215-pound weight class, Scales enjoyed an
																									amazing 112-9 career record. He won back-to-back Ohio Division I state
																									titles as he posted a perfect 88-0 record in his final two seasons,
																									after finishing third in the state as a sophomore. He was twice named
																									<i>The Cincinnati Enquirer's</i> Division I Wrestler of the Year and
																									was a three-time First-Team All-City selection.
																								</p>
																								<p>Scales carried his wrestling success on at the collegiate level where
																									he was a two-time NAIA All-American at Notre Dame College in
																									Cleveland. There he was a National Runner-Up and a National Champion.
																									He was an NCAA Division II All-American in 2012-13 where he finished
																									fifth in the nation. ND College was the National Dual Meeting
																									Champions in Scales' first two seasons, and was runner-up in the
																									Nationals as NCAA Division II. Scales was an assistant coach at Elder
																									high school and a volunteer assistant at Mount Saint Joseph
																									University. He helped coach four state placers at Elder and three.All
																									Americans at MSJ. </p>
																								<p>Scales and his wife, Ashley, currently live in Cleveland have twin

																								<p>Few coaches had a love for the game as much as Jerry Doerger as his
																									career spanned five decades with three different schools – Moeller
																									(1966-1970), McNicholas (1975-2002) and Clermont Northeastern
																									(2004-10) – an amazing total of 59 years! Coach Doerger compiled a
																									537-354 career record which ranks No. 4 All-time in Cincinnati
																									basketball history and ranks 35th All-time in Ohio basketball history.
																								</p>
																								<p>His awards and accomplishments were, understandably, lengthy. His
																									teams won 17 sectional championships, 11 district titles, nine
																									regional titles and reached the Final Four with McNicholas five times
																									in his career. Doerger's teams have been named Cincinnati Enquirer
																									City Champions twice. Inducted into the Ohio High School Basketball
																									Coaches Hall of Fame in 2011, he was also inducted into McNicholas'
																									Hall of Fame the same year. Ten years later, in 2021, the Rockets
																									dedicated their basketball floor in honor of Coach Doerger. He was
																									selected for the Greater Cincinnati Hall of Fame in 1990. He has
																									received both the Bron Bacevich Award and the Dick Berning Award.</p>
																								<p>More than 30 of his players have gone on to receive college
																									scholarships – including LaRosa's Hall of Famer and NFL star Steve
																									Sylvester, University of Dayton star and Olympic Silver Medalist, Mike
																									Sylvester, LaRosa Hall of Famer and Cincinnati Reds star, Buddy Bell
																									and former major leaguers, Len Matuszek and LaRosa Hall of Famer Pat
																									Tabler. Many others went on to become collegiate stars including Mike
																									Ramey at Xavier and Craig Sanders at Northern Kentucky University.
																									Currently, Doerger is retired and lives in Anderson.</p>

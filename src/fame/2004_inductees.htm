                                            The Buddy LaRosa high school Sports Hall of Fame was established
                                            in 1975 to recognize outstanding athletes from area high schools.
                                            Each year, nominees are considered based solely upon high school
                                            accomplishments. Collegiate, professional, or other amateur achievements
                                            have no bearing on the selection process. The nominee must have
                                            graduated high school 10 years before eligibility may begin.

                                                Upon his retirement after 45 years of coaching at Hamilton
                                                Catholic and Badin High Schools, Terry amassed a career record
                                                of 360-177-8 � the most victories in Ohio high school history,
                                                and 10 th all-time in the nation. <br>
                                                <br>
                                                During his career, Malone's team captured the 1990 Division
                                                III state championship and was runnerup in both 1978 and
                                                1980. Along with his 16-6 victory over Richfield Revere for
                                                the state title, Malone achievements have included triumphs
                                                over two of Ohio's greatest coaching legends and LaRosa Hall
                                                of Famers � Roger Bacon's Bron Bacevich (1972) and Princeton's
                                                Pat Mancuso (1969). <br>
                                                <br>
                                                Malone was a 1952 graduate of Hamilton Catholic, and went
                                                on to star in football at Xavier University where he was
                                                All-Irish/All-Catholic All-American in 1956. He holds XU's
                                                record for longest kickoff return of 98 yards vs. the University
                                                of Cincinnati in 1956. Upon graduating from XU, Malone actually
                                                signed a contract with North College Hill High School, but
                                                when the opening arose at Hamilton Catholic, he asked out
                                                and was granted his release to return to his alma mater.
                                                Ironically, it was a 45-7 victory over NCH that was the final
                                                game of his career. (Interestingly enough, NCH was also the
                                                final foe for Bacon's Bacevich.) <br>
                                                <br>
                                                One of Malone's favorite stories was the third game of his
                                                career � his first home game � when he recalled an older
                                                female fan deriding his coaching and insisting he would not
                                                be back for a second season! �I guess I fooled her a little
                                                bit,� he says, chuckling. <br>
                                                <br>
                                                Terry went on to post a 63-12-1 record at Catholic which
                                                merged with Notre Dame High School to form Badin in 1966-67.
                                                In 38 years with Badin, the Rams were 280-90-7 in regular
                                                season play, and 17-15 in postseason. Malone posted seven
                                                unbeaten/untied seasons, one 8-0-2 mark, and 14 teams that
                                                lost just one game. The Rams reached the playoffs 16 times.
                                                In addition to being head football coach, Malone was also
                                                Dean of Boys, Athletic Director and taught American History
                                                for 47 years at Badin. <br>

                                                He has been inducted into numerous Halls of Fame, including

                                                Cincinnati in the last 50 years, Claude Osteen went from
                                                Reading High School to enjoy an 18-year career in the major

                                                Osteen, who moved to Reading from Tennessee as a sophomore,
                                                totally dominated high school baseball during his three-year
                                                varsity career. Osteen also played basketball for two seasons
                                                for the Blue Devils, but concentrated solely on baseball
                                                as a senior. And it proved to be a magic year for him. <br>

                                                history as one of the finest pitching seasons ever recorded.
                                                The Blue Devils captured its first state championship in
                                                any team sport, largely behind Osteen, who did the unthinkable
                                                in today's prep game. The left-hander pitched back-to-back
                                                shutouts in the regional tournament � on the same day! <br>
                                                <br>
                                                Osteen, 23-1 overall in his prep career, went 16-0 as a senior.
                                                He pitched 103 2/3 innings with an incredible 221 strikeouts.
                                                He allowed just two earned runs for a 0.13 Earned-run-average
                                                (based upon 7 innings pitched per game). He walked just 20
                                                batters and gave up only 32 hits. <br>

                                                Going into the 2005 prep baseball season, both his ERA and
                                                his strikeouts rank No. 1 in Ohio history, while his 20-strikeout
                                                game is tied for fifth best ever. <br>
                                                <br>
                                                Osteen still holds five Reading single-season school records � most
                                                hits (41), innings pitched, most wins, most strikeouts and
                                                lowest ERA. He ranks 1-2-3 in single game strikeouts (20-17-17),
                                                and second in single-season runs scored (31). <br>
                                                <br>
                                                With such success, it was easy to understand how he would
                                                sign with the Cincinnati Reds right out of high school. And
                                                while most people in Cincinnati remember Joe Nuxhall pitching
                                                for the Cincinnati Reds as a high school student, Osteen
                                                actually pitched for the Reds following his graduation � throwing
                                                4 innings in three games in 1957! <br>
                                                <br>
                                                Osteen went on to pitch for six different teams in the major
                                                leagues over an 18-year career. He posted a 196-195 record
                                                with 3,460 1/3 innings pitched for a 3.30 career ERA. His
                                                finest years came with the Los Angeles Dodgers (1964-1973)
                                                where he won 152 games, including 20-win seasons in 1969
                                                and 1972. He won 15 games as part of the 1965 World Championship
                                                Dodgers' team. A four-time All-Star in his career, Claude
                                                went on to become a minor league and major league pitching

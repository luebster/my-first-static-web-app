																								<p>The first of four straight state championship girls' cross-country
																									teams coached by <i>LaRosa's Hall of Fame</i> Coach <b>Ron Russo</b>,
																									the 1997 squad was arguably the best of the lot. The team was never
																									really challenged throughout the season and wound up being recognized
																									as the No. 3-ranked girls' team in the nation. The team brought home
																									the first girls state title in Colerain history.</p>

																								<p>"The previous year when we finished second in the state, it was at
																									that moment that the girls believed they could win the following
																									year," Russo said. "They did it in convincing fashion."</p>

																								<p>Seeking national recognition that season, the team went to the
																									nationally prestigious Penn State Invitational, hoping for a matchup
																									against No. 1 Saratoga Springs. The New York team was a no-show.
																									Colerain won the meet handily.</p>

																								<p>Powered by Team Captains <b>Alison Zeinner</b> and <b>Gerri Buck</b>,
																									the Lady Cardinals won the Ohio Division I state title by 71 points.
																									In scoring a team-low 56 points, the Cardinals placed four girls in
																									the top 25 finishers led by individual state champion <b>Kelly
																										Crum</b> 18:26 over 3.1 miles. She was followed by Zeinner (18:43),
																									Buck (18:58), <b>Angie Kist</b> (19:00), <b>Catie Grebe</b> (19:12),
																									<b>Terie Littlepage</b> (20:10) and <b>Alison Bedingfield</b> (21:03).
																								</p>

																								<p>As a testament to how good this team was – 11 of the runners went on
																									to become Division I collegiate runners – Zeinner, Crum, Grebe, Buck,
																									Kist, Bedingfield, Littlepage, <b>Cece Kinne, Jennifer Limle, Lori
																										Siconolfi</b> and <b>Andrea Maas.</b></p>

																								<p>In addition to the state title, the team won the Greater Miami
																									Conference, the district and regional titles, as well as being ranked
																									No. 1 in Cincinnati.</p>

																								<p>"It was and is the greatest team I ever coached," Russo said.
																									"Everything about them was special. They were very coachable,
																									hard-working and disciplined. They never missed practice and their
																									training days were epic to watch … with the group, I never walked into
																									a meet thinking we might get beat."</p>

																								<p>Okay, so it's the Ohio Division II state championship game and one
																									team has a player who became arguably the greatest basketball player
																									of all time.</p>

																								<p>To a handful of players from St. Bernard, however, the concept of
																									TEAM really meant that. For Roger Bacon High School, the 2001-02 may
																									well be considered the school's greatest team ever. </p>

																								<p>The team would set a school record for the most victories (25-3) and
																									won the Greater Cincinnati League title (13-1). Its legacy was made
																									with a victory in one of the most talked about games in the history of
																									Cincinnati prep basketball – a 71-63 victory over Akron St. Vincent-St
																									Mary and its star player, LeBron James.</p>

																								<p>LeBron guaranteed victory in a TV interview the night before the
																									state title game. A state-tournament record crowd of 18,375 packed
																									Ohio State's Value City Arena. Most expected SVSM to cruise to its
																									third straight Division II title with James. The Irish were 75-0
																									against Ohio teams in James' first three years, losing only three
																									games against the best national competition.</p>

																								<p>A year before, the late coach Bill Brewer knew he would have a strong
																									team, so he added a December game against James and the Irish at the
																									MAC Center at Kent State. The game was tied at 66 with four minutes to
																									go, and although SVSM won, 79-70, the Spartans vowed the next time
																									would be different.</p>

																								<p>"The atmosphere in the locker room at the conclusion of that game was
																									one of anger, but more importantly, opportunity," said Brian Neal,
																									assistant coach at the time. "Every one of our players knew that while
																									LeBron was a great player and SVSM a very good team, they were
																									beatable. This was one of Coach Brewer's finest hours and probably the
																									best coaching move that he ever made."</p>

																								<p>Roger Bacon was no team to overlook. The Spartans were tall,
																									aggressive on both offense and defense, and determined. They had four
																									double-figure scorers, led by 6-3 all-state guard <b>Josh
																										Hausfeld</b>.</p>

																								<p>Brewer's plan to stop James was to not try to stop him. He hoped
																									<b>Beckham Wyrick</b> could contain James man-to-man with <b>Monty St.
																										Clair</b> and <b>Frank Phillips</b> taking turns and assigned the
																									others including <b>Dave Johnson</b>, to shut down James' teammates.
																								</p>

																								<p>His plan worked for the first three quarters. James had only eight
																									points at halftime. Roger Bacon led by 11 late in the third quarter.
																									But James brought the Irish back. He made a steal at half-court and
																									soared for a thunderous dunk that brought the crowd to its feet. Then
																									he hit a half-court shot at the buzzer to cut Bacon's lead to five. By
																									then, James had four fouls, but he took over on offense. He moved to
																									the low post and scored 13 points in the last eight minutes. He dunked
																									to make it 66-63 with 30 seconds left. James then had a chance to tie
																									the game, but he passed off, and a teammate missed a 3. Another Irish
																									player's technical foul helped Bacon hold on.</p>

																								<p>James, who finished with 32 points, was gracious in defeat. He went
																									over to the Roger Bacon bench and hugged and congratulated the
																									Spartans.</p>

																								<p>Roger Bacon had four scorers in double figures (Hausfeld 23, St.
																									Clair 15, Wyrick 14 and Phillips 13). SVSM had two. When it came time
																									to pick the all-tourney team, it was those four Roger Bacon players
																									and LeBron. Hausfeld was MVP.</p>

																								<p>The Spartans – the only Ohio team to ever beat LeBron – knew right
																									away they had done something special. "They had the best player, but
																									we had the better team," said Brewer, who died of a heart attack in
																									2007. "… the team chemistry this group developed was something quite
																									special. They were a group of guys who genuinely liked being around
																									each other," Neal said. "… As a show of solidarity and team building,
																									the Spartans decided that they would all do something a little
																									extreme, shave their heads … it was a bold move (and not a great look)
																									for many of the other Spartans."</p>

																								<p>The team recently got back together as part of an ESPN production
																									showcasing the 20th anniversary of RB's state championship and Neal
																									noted, "The lasting memory from that weekend was seeing these guys who
																									met each other as teen boys now laughing and sharing stories as men –
																									as husbands, as fathers, as business owners, as coaches. They are
																									champions in more than high school basketball."</p>

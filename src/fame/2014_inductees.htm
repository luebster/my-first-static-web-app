																								<p>Believed to be the first Cincinnati athlete to be regarded as the No.
																									1 Player in Ohio in two different sports (basketball and baseball) in
																									the same season, Andrew Brackman clearly is one of Greater
																									Cincinnati's finest male high school athletes in the early part of the
																									21st century. He is one of only 15 athletes in the last 30 years to be
																									a first ballot inductee into the LaRosa's Hall of Fame.</p>

																								<p>Brackman was an integral part in two state titles in two different
																									sports for Moeller - the 2003 Ohio Division I basketball title and the
																									2004 state baseball title. He was named The Cincinnati Enquirer's
																									Player of the Year in both sports in 2004.</p>

																								<p>The No. 1 prep prospect in Ohio (Baseball America 2004), Brackman
																									posted a 19-1 career pitching record. His 1.04 career ERA ranks No. 2
																									in Moeller history and is No. 14 in Ohio history.</p>

																								<p>As a senior (7-0 with a 0.58 ERA), Brackman was overpowering in the
																									2004 state tournament as he dominated Cleveland St. Ignatius with 11
																									strikeouts in posting a 6-1 semifinal victory. He came back two days
																									later and nailed down the state title with a save in a 6-2 victory
																									over Mentor.</p>

																								<p>In basketball, Brackman was named runner-up for Ohio Mr. Basketball
																									(2004) and was the Associated Press Div.I Co-Player of the Year. A
																									two-year starter at Moeller, he scored 942 points and had 320
																									rebounds.</p>

																								<p>Though baseball was, arguably, his best sport, the 6-foot-9 Brackman
																									played both sports at North Carolina State. He signed a basketball
																									scholarship, playing two seasons as center-forward. He averaged 7.4
																									points, 3.5 rebounds. In three seasons as a starting pitcher, he
																									compiled an 11-8 record with 74 strikeouts in 78 IP. His career was
																									cut short by Tommy John surgery.</p>

																								<p>Brackman was the 1st round pick of the New York Yankees in 2007 (30th
																									overall) in the Major League baseball draft. Tommy John surgery
																									followed him throughout his career. He pitched 2.1 innings in the
																									majors with the Yankees. He played in the Yankees, Reds and White Sox
																									organizations.</p>

																								<p>Brackman lives in Raleigh, N.C. and is finishing up his degree at
																									North Carolina State.</p>

																								<p>Over the last 25 years, Whitney Myers Burnett and former prep
																									teammate Erin Phenix, are arguably the two finest female swimmers to
																									come out of Greater Cincinnati.</p>

																								<p>Myers won 11 Ohio state championships, including a state-record eight
																									individual gold medals. As a senior, she captured the 200-yard
																									freestyle title for the fourth straight year and set a state record in
																									the 100-yard butterfly (53.89), which she set the year before. She
																									finished her prep career holding three Ohio state records in the 100
																									butterfly, the 200-yard freestyle (1:47.19 in 2002) and the 200-yard
																									freestyle relay (1:35.38 in 2002). The 200-yard freestyle record stood
																									until 2014. She was the LaRosa's Female Athlete of the Year as a
																									junior.</p>

																								<p>The Lions won three state championships and one runner-up finish
																									during Myers' career. She was twice named Ohio Swimmer of the Year
																									(2000 and 2002), was 1st team All-American four straight years, and
																									was 1st team all-city three times. Additionally, twice she was named
																									Swimmer or Co-Swimmer of the Year by The Enquirer (2002 and 2003) and
																									she was selected as the High School Sportswoman of the Year by the
																									Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Women's Sports Association.</p>

																								<p>Her collegiate career at the University of Arizona was equally
																									impressive. As team captain for three consecutive years, Whitney was
																									the 2006 NCAA champion in the 200 IM, 400 IM and 400 medley relay. She
																									also was the 2007 NCAA champion in the 200 IM. She was named the 2006
																									Pac-10 Swimmer of the Year and was the NCAA's Woman of the Year. She
																									finished her collegiate career holding 14 UA school records and was
																									inducted in to the UA Athletic Hall of Fame in 2013.</p>

																								<p>In international competition, Whitney finished third in the 200
																									butterfly in the 2004 Olympic Trials, finished fourth in the 200 IM in
																									the 2005 and 2007 World Championships. She was a World Champion as a
																									member of the 800 freestyle relay in 2005 and Pan Pacific champion in
																									the 200 IM in 2006. For these swims, she was awarded USA Swimming's
																									Golden Goggles for Relay Performance of the Year and Breakout
																									Performance of the Year. Whitney was team captain at the 2011 Pan
																									American Games. </p>

																								<p>Currently, Whitney Myers Burnett is living with her husband,
																									three-time Olympian Simon Burnett, in Pasadena, California, where she
																									is a practicing Physician Assistant.</p>

																								<p>When Elder High School selected its greatest athletes' team in 1973,
																									Dan James was regarded as the best of the best. More than 40 years
																									later, there would be little argument that that accolade still stands
																									today.</p>

																								<p>His high school, college and pro careers only reaffirm the late Dan
																									James' athletic prowess. A two-way starter as center on offense and
																									linebacker on defense, James always was proud of being able to play on
																									the varsity team as a freshman - a very rare accomplishment back then
																									- with his older brother, Jim. </p>

																								<p>A three-year starter at both positions, James' prep career culminated
																									in Elder's 1954 undefeated season - a team regarded by many local
																									historians as one of Cincinnati's greatest football squads. The
																									Cincinnati city champions and Greater Cincinnati League champs,
																									allowed only 65 points the entire season.</p>

																								<p>Dan James was considered the driving force behind that team's
																									success. He was named a prep All-Catholic All-American, a consensus
																									1st team all-state selection by UPI and the Ohio Sports Writers
																									Association. A 1st team all-city pick by The Cincinnati Enquirer, the
																									Times-Star and the Cincinnati Post, James played in the North-South
																									All-Star game in Massillon.</p>

																								<p>Heavily recruited, James went on to Ohio State where he was a
																									three-year starter as guard and center. He started on Woody Hayes'
																									1957 National Championship team. The Big Ten champs won the Rose Bowl
																									against Oregon, 10-7, in 1958. James was named captain of the College
																									All-Star team that played the Baltimore Colts in the 1959 North-South
																									Shrine game.</p>

																								<p>Professionally, James was the first round pick of the San Francisco
																									49ers (eighth overall) in 1959 and went on to play almost eight
																									seasons with San Francisco, Pittsburgh and the Chicago Bears. James
																									started every game with Pittsburgh and Chicago until his retirement in
																									1967. He went on to be a professional scout for three seasons with the
																									Oakland Raiders.</p>

																								<p>In 1999, James was named to The Enquirer's All-Century football team
																									as a member of the offensive line. </p>

																								<p>Dan James is survived by his wife, Carole Rinear, and six children -
																									Dan, Chris, David, Joni, Tim and Patrick. </p>

																								<p>Bryn Kehoe could well be the finest volleyball player in Greater

																								<p>A four-year starter at St. Ursula, Kehoe led the Bulldogs to two Ohio
																									Division I state championships (2001 and 2003) and a state runner-up
																									finish in 2002. Twice named the Ohio Division I Player of the Year,
																									Kehoe was a two-time PrepVolleyball.com All-American, which also named
																									her the No. 1 volleyball player in the nation in 2003. She was the
																									inaugural recipient of the Andi Collins Award (2003), emblematic of
																									the Best Setter in the United States.</p>

																								<p>Kehoe was the Ohio Gatorade Player of the Year (2003), The Cincinnati
																									Enquirer Player of the Year and the recipient of the 2003 Southwest
																									Ohio Officials Association Lifetime Achievement Award. She was the
																									LaRosa's Female Athlete of the Year in 2004, and is one of only 15 in
																									the Hall of Fame to be inducted on the first ballot.</p>

																								<p>Kehoe continued her athletic excellence at Stanford University. A
																									four-year starter, she was the only starting freshman to win an NCAA
																									team championship (2004). She went on to play in two other national
																									championship games. She was a three-time NCAA All-American. As a
																									senior, she was a two-time 1st team All-American and was named the
																									CVU.com Setter of the Year. She set numerous single-game and
																									single-season records, and finished as Stanford's No. 1 all-time
																									assists leader with 5,956, which was also third-best in Pac-10 history
																									and one of the top 25 Best in NCAA history.</p>

																								<p>In addition to her college career, Kehoe played for Team USA -
																									competing for the U.S. Women's National Team in 2005 at the Montreux
																									Masters. She was the starting setter for the U.S. Women's Junior
																									National Team that competed in 2005 at the FIVB World Championship in
																									Turkey and was a member of the 2004 U.S. Women's Junior National Team
																									that won the gold medal at the NORCECA Continental Championship. She
																									also played on Team USA in China in 2010.</p>

																								<p>As a professional, Kehoe played three seasons for Sagres NUC in
																									Switzerland, where she was team captain in 2013.</p>

																								<p>Kehoe came by her talents naturally as both her father, Steve, and
																									mother, Amy - a two-time collegiate All-American -- played collegiate
																									volleyball. Currently, Bryn Kehoe is the assistant volleyball coach at
																									the University of Alabama.</p>

																								<p>One of the finest track and cross-country coaches in Greater
																									Cincinnati and regarded as the dean of Northern Kentucky running,
																									Barry Binkley has turned a high school passion into a much-honored
																									career.</p>

																								<p>Coach Binkley has guided teams to six Kentucky state championships
																									and 15 state runner-up finishes. During his 25-year career at Dayton
																									High School, he led an eight-year run where his girls' teams were
																									either state champs (twice) or runners-up (six times). In his 49-year
																									career, Binkley has coached at seven different schools, including
																									Batavia and Elder in Ohio, and finished this past school year as an
																									assistant coach at Simon Kenton.</p>

																								<p>Coach Binkley played a crucial role in establishing girls'
																									cross-country as a sport in Kentucky. He formed the first girls' team
																									in Northern Kentucky while at Holmes in 1974 - allowing girls to run
																									races on their own (they previously ran with boys teams). He was
																									instrumental in inaugurating the Kentucky Girls State Cross Country
																									program in 1975.</p>

																								<p>In 1979, Coach Binkley moved to Dayton, Kentucky, where he enjoyed
																									his greatest success, sparked in part by LaRosa's Hall of Famer
																									Adrienne Hundemer (20 individual state titles) and Stephanie Edgar (14
																									individual state titles). The Greendevils' program won five state
																									championships - girls state track (1992, 1995), boys cross country
																									(1983, 1985) and boys track (state Indoor 1994) - and recorded 14
																									state runner-up finishes. As an assistant coach, he won state titles
																									in 2005 (Lloyd girls track) and in 2011 (St. Henry boys cross
																									country).</p>

																								<p>Coach Binkley has been named Coach of the Year 10 times during his
																									career by various organizations, including the National Federation
																									Interscholastic Coaches Association (1984) and Scholastic Coach
																									Magazine (cross country 1988). He has been inducted in the Kentucky
																									Track and Cross Country Coaches Association Hall of Fame, the Northern
																									Kentucky Athletic Directors Hall of Fame and the Northern Kentucky
																									Sports Hall of Fame.</p>

																								<p>As a high school athlete, Binkley was an exceptional runner in his
																									own right. He placed seventh (1957) and fourth (1958) in the Ohio
																									state cross country meets at Woodward. He set the school record in the
																									mile run (4:36) and was district track champ in the 880 as a senior in
																									1959. He earned a full scholarship to Bowling Green State University,
																									where he set three school records and finished No. 2 in the mile at
																									the 1963 Mid-American Conference championships.</p>

																								<p>Coach Binkley, and his wife, Janice, currently live in Alexandria and
																									have a daughter (Molly).</p>

                                            The Buddy LaRosa high school Sports Hall of Fame was established
                                            in 1975 to recognize outstanding athletes from area high schools.
                                            Each year, nominees are considered based solely upon high school
                                            accomplishments. Collegiate, professional, or other amateur achievements
                                            have no bearing on the selection process. The nominee must have
                                            graduated high school 10 years before eligibility may begin.

                                                <p>In Greater Cincinnati coaching circles, Stan Arnzen&rsquo;s name is
                                                  legendary. He has been inducted into numerous Halls of Fame as a
                                                  coach, but Stan Arnzen the athlete has not been as well-recognized. It
                                                  is the prep star at Newport High School that LaRosa&rsquo;s honors as

                                                  <br>
                                                  A four-year starter in both basketball and baseball, Arnzen was feared
                                                  on the basketball court, but may well have been a better baseball
                                                  player. While no statistics remain from Arnzen&rsquo;s playing days,
                                                  he led Newport to the 1932 Ninth Region basketball championship as a
                                                  freshman. The team reached the Final Four, but Arnzen was unable to
                                                  play because of a severe ankle injury.<br>
                                                  <br>
                                                  While Newport never returned to the Sweet Sixteen during his playing
                                                  days, Arnzen&rsquo;s personal career continued to gather honors. He
                                                  was named All-State both his junior and senior season. Legendary UCLA
                                                  coach John Wooden, whose coaching career began at Dayton High School,
                                                  recalled Arnzen as &ldquo;an outstanding player for
                                                  Newport.&rdquo;<br>
                                                  <br>
                                                  Stan went on to play college basketball at Morehead State where he was
                                                  named team captain as a freshman and earned Southern Intercollegiate
                                                  Athletic Association honors. While at Morehead, his other passion came
                                                  into play as he was drafted and signed with the Cleveland Indians. In
                                                  his first professional season, playing for the West Virginia Miners,
                                                  Arnzen led the minor leagues in hitting with a .387 batting average.
                                                  He earned the prestigious Spalding Trophy, emblematic as the 1937
                                                  Outstanding Minor League rookie. <b>There were 32 minor leagues</b> in
                                                  operation at that time, making Arnzen&rsquo;s accomplishment even more
                                                  remarkable.<br>
                                                  In his second season of pro ball, the Cincinnati Reds purchased
                                                  Arnzen&rsquo;s contract. He was leading the Reds in hitting with a
                                                  .457 average when he suffered a career-ending injury with a broken leg
                                                  while sliding into second base.<br>
                                                  <br>
                                                  With his athletic career behind him, Arnzen turned his focus to
                                                  coaching and took the same intensity with him. He returned to Newport
                                                  and <i>never</i> suffered a losing season in 22 years as basketball
                                                  coach. He compiled a 452-169 career record, winning the Ninth Region
                                                  title five times and coaching the 1954 Kentucky state runners-up. In
                                                  addition, he coached baseball for 16 years, posting 15 winning
                                                  seasons.

                                                Both Stan and his wife of 40 years, Jean, are deceased. Stan passed away
                                                in 1977. They are survived by daughters Donna Dahmann and Joann

                                                  occupies a hallowed space. The first team state championship in the
                                                  school&rsquo;s history was the 1994 track team. In the 26-24 victory
                                                  over runners-up Mansfield, Doug Bockenstette accounted for 24 points.
                                                  Doug was just that kind of dominating distance runner in high school
                                                  &ndash; if not the best in Greater Cincinnati history, surely one of

                                                  captured the 1600-meter run in 4:10.14, and then followed with a state

                                                  anchored the Lancers&rsquo; 3200-meter relay team, which finished
                                                  fourth. He went on to finish first in the Track &amp; Field Midwest
                                                  Meet of Champions (9:03.25) and his third place finish in the U.S.

                                                  After serving four years as an assistant and defensive coordinator at
                                                  Moeller, Steve picked up right where his predecessors left off &ndash;
                                                  leading the Crusaders to a 13-0 season, the Ohio Division I state
                                                  championship and the mythical national championship. <i>USA Today</i>

                                                  The Moeller program was in wonderful hands as Klonne coached the
                                                  Crusaders for another 18 years. He compiled a 169-48 record and
                                                  <i>never</i> had a losing season during a tenure that saw Moeller win
                                                  two Ohio Division I state championships (1982 and 1985), three state
                                                  runners-up (1989, 1993 and 1997), five Regional championships, four
                                                  Cincinnati city titles and nine Greater Cincinnati League titles.
                                                  Steve's accomplishments earned him a spot in the Moeller Hall of

                                                  for the Rockets in 2005. His team won the GCL Central championship in

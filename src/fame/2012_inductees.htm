                                            The Buddy LaRosa high school Sports Hall of Fame was established
                                            in 1975 to recognize outstanding athletes from area high schools.
                                            Each year, nominees are considered based solely upon high school
                                            accomplishments. Collegiate, professional, or other amateur achievements
                                            have no bearing on the selection process. The nominee must have
                                            graduated high school 10 years before eligibility may begin.

                                                  High School, Jackie Kemper may well be the school's finest volleyball
                                                  player. A star in both volleyball and basketball, Jackie Kemper's

                                                  player in Cincinnati. She was a two-time First Team All-City

                                                <p>One of the finest all-around athletes at Withrow in the early 1950s,
                                                  Tad Schroeder earned 13 varsity letters in five different sports
                                                  during his four-year prep career with the Tigers.</p>
                                                <p>Tad earned three varsity letters each in football, basketball,
                                                  swimming and baseball, and one in track. Keep in mind that both
                                                  swimming and basketball, track and baseball seasons occur
                                                  simultaneously.</p>
                                                <p>In football, he was a two-way starter at quarterback and defensive
                                                  back, as well as the team's punter. But he also reached the state
                                                  swimming tournament three straight years.</p>
                                                <p>In earning three varsity letters in basketball, he helped lead the
                                                  Tigers to the 1952 Final Four. While playing baseball at either first
                                                  or third base for three seasons, he managed to qualify for the state
                                                  track meet as part of Withrow's relay team.</p>
                                                <p>His varied athletic career continued at the University of Cincinnati,
                                                  where he lettered in baseball in 1956, football in 1957 and swimming
                                                  in 1958.</p>
                                                <p>Football, however, proved to be his love. He went on to become the
                                                  assistant football coach at Army from 1962-66. He became head coach of
                                                  the United States Coast Guard Academy from 1968-73. When he took over
                                                  the program, the USCGA was undergoing an 18-game losing streak. He
                                                  turned the program around, compiling a 29-31 record, including two 8-2
                                                  seasons.</p>
                                                <p>Returning to the United State Military Academy in 1973, he worked as
                                                  the Assistant Director of Athletics in various roles until 1980. He
                                                  founded his own investment firm through most of the 1980s, and then
                                                  worked through 2010 as a University Representative for the Collegiate

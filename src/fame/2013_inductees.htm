																								<p>Charlie Fredrick, Class of 1955, was the first truly great athlete to
																									come out of Newport Catholic High School, earning five varsity letters
																									-- two in basketball and three in football -- and then was a
																									successful coach for nearly four decades.</p>
																								<p>In football, Fredrick was the leading rusher in Northern Kentucky as
																									a senior and was an honorable mention all-state selection. His most
																									memorable game was the last one he played - when he scored three
																									touchdowns and kicked two PATs in a 20-20 tie vs. McNicholas in the
																									final game of the 1954 season.</p>
																								<p>After high school, Fredrick received a full scholarship to play
																									football at the University of Notre Dame, where he played under the
																									legendary coach Terry Brennan. Fredrick was part of the 1958 team that
																									ended Oklahoma's 47-game winning streak.</p>
																								<p>Following college, Fredrick spent the next 38 years involved in
																									coaching or administering secondary education. He became head football
																									coach at NewCath in 1961 and five years later the Thoroughbreds were
																									ranked No. 1 in Kentucky. He also started the track and field team at
																									NewCath in 1963 and won the 9th Region titles in 1964 and 1965.</p>
																								<p>After a year of coaching at Highlands, Fredrick became head football
																									coach at Greenhills High School, and the Athletic Director in 1971. He
																									served as the district's athletic coordinator for 28 years.</p>
																								<p>With his induction, Fredrick becomes the third father-son inductee
																									into the LaRosa's High School Hall of Fame, but the first to have his
																									son (Joe, Greenhills High School, Class of 1986, LaRosa's HOF class of
																									2008)) inducted before himself!</p>
																								<p>Fredrick has been inducted into the Ohio Interscholastic Athletic
																									Administrators Hall of Fame (1994), the first inductee into the Winton
																									Woods Hall of Fame (2002) and the Newport Central Catholic Hall of
																									Fame (2007).</p>
																								<p>Now retired, Charlie and his wife, Mary Jo, live in Northern
																									Kentucky. They have four children (Chuck 52, Mike 51, Maureen 49, Joe
																									45) and 11 grandchildren.</p>

																								<p>Smith was just that kind of stellar athlete - earning nine varsity

																								<p>Smith was named KHSAA Player of the Year, the Gatorade Kentucky

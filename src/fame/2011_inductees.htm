                                            The Buddy LaRosa high school Sports Hall of Fame was established
                                            in 1975 to recognize outstanding athletes from area high schools.
                                            Each year, nominees are considered based solely upon high school
                                            accomplishments. Collegiate, professional, or other amateur achievements
                                            have no bearing on the selection process. The nominee must have
                                            graduated high school 10 years before eligibility may begin.

                                                  greatest swimmers in Sycamore High and Greater Cincinnati history.
                                                  During his high school career, Dan collected six state swimming
                                                  championships, was a national high school champion, a two-time
                                                  national runner-up and a 14-time high school All-American. Dan was

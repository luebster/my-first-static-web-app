																								<p>No truer words were spoken about the 1976 Moeller football team than
																									on Friday, November 27, 1976 when Gahanna Lincoln football coach Neal
																									Billman surveyed the 43-5 wreckage of his previously undefeated team
																									in the Ohio Class AAA state championship game and said "I don't think
																									there’s ever been another team like them … More than anyone I’ve ever
																									seen, they do it all."</p>

																								<p>Indeed, coach Gerry Faust's second straight state championship team
																									was as close to perfect as the Crusaders' 12-0 record, which led to
																									the school's first mythical national championship.</p>

																								<p>Three LaRosa's Hall of Famers were part of that team – Faust,
																									quarterback Tim Koegel and linebacker Bob Crable. Moeller crushed
																									Youngstown Cardinal Mooney in the state semifinals, 48-0, giving the
																									team 490 points scored and 40 allowed during the entire season.</p>

																								<p>Koegel was named Ohio's consensus Back of the Year by both the
																									Associated Press and United Press International, as was Lineman of the
																									Year Jim Brown. Crable, only a junior, was consensus All-State. The
																									offense also featured all-state end Dave Condeni and running backs Bob
																									Massong and Steve Givens.</p>

																								<p>"This is the best team we've ever had," Faust said after the state
																									title game. "Character makes winners … this year's team and last
																									year's team both had it. This one just had more ability."</p>

																								<p>In Ohio's hotbed of volleyball, arguably Greater Cincinnati's best
																									team ever was the unbeaten St. Ursula team of 2003.</p>

																								<p>Julie Perry, a LaRosa's Hall of Fame coach, guided this team through
																									a perfect 29-0 season and a national championship. In fact, her team
																									was rated No. 1 in the nation the entire year and never wavered from
																									that spot. </p>

																								<p>This team featured another LaRosa's Hall of Famer in Bryn Kehoe, who
																									was one of four seniors who went on to play collegiately. Kehoe went
																									on to Stanford, while Beth Shelton played for Virginia, Beth Gillming
																									starred at Maryland and Erin Schroeder played at Dayton.</p>

																								<p>Perry knew she had the makings of a special team right from the
																									start. In fact, as she is quick to point out – she knew this was a
																									team of destiny because of the last game of the previous season.</p>

																								<p>"When we lost to Ursuline Academy in the fifth game of the 2002 state
																									championship by two points, that was the moment that proved to be the
																									motivating factor," Perry says. "I could tell they were going to be
																									strong from the first day … The team made our coaches work harder than
																									ever – each of us pushing each other to leave it all on the court."
																								</p>

																								<p>St. Ursula’s drive to the title was relentless throughout the season
																									and was probably best demonstrated in the Ohio Division I state title
																									game when they again met rival Ursuline Academy. The Lions delivered a
																									crushing result with a 15-10, 15-7 victory.</p>

																								<p>"It has been an honor to coach every one of my student athletes over
																									the years whether we won state or ended the season in the earlier
																									tournament round," Perry said. "It is all about the journey and what a
																									journey the 2003 team, the coaches, the players' families and our
																									school community had."</p>

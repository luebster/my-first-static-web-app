																								<p>Arguably the greatest basketball player in Northern Kentucky history,
																									Dicky Beal was regarded as the 12th best player in Greater Cincinnati
																									history in an article by the Cincinnati Enquirer on the area's Top 100
																									players of all time. Beal is certainly one of the two top players in
																									Holmes basketball history along with Mr. Basketball Doug Schloemer, a
																									LaRosa's Hall of Fame Inductee.</p>

																								<p>A high school All-American, Beal was heavily recruited as a high
																									school senior and wound up going to the University of Kentucky.</p>

																								<p>As a senior at Holmes, Beal helped lead the Bulldogs to a 33-3 record
																									and a spot in the championship game – which was the infamous Charles
																									Hurt non-goal-tending call game that denied Holmes and the Ninth
																									Region its first Kentucky state title.</p>

																								<p>In the 1979-80 season, he averaged 23.6 points, 6.5 rebounds and 8.3
																									assists. He scored a career-high 50 points against Holy Cross that
																									year as well. In his career, he shot 55% from the field and 68% from
																									the free throw line. He was named Ninth Region Player of the Year,
																									first team All-State and first-team All-State Tournament Team. He was
																									named both The Kentucky Post and Kentucky Enquirer Player of the Year.
																								</p>

																								<p>Beal went on to play for UK, where he appeared in 111 games. He
																									scored 460 career points (154-of-296) and hit 152-of-219 from the free
																									throw line. He had 108 rebounds, 301 assists and 85 steals. He was
																									named the NCAA Regional's Most Outstanding Player in 1983-84 and
																									received UK's Outstanding Leadership Award.</p>

																								<p>Beal was hampered by knee injuries near the end of his college career
																									– enduring three arthroscopic surgeries on his right knee between his
																									junior and senior year. Though drafted by the Atlanta Hawks of the
																									NBA, the knee injuries prevented him from enjoying a professional
																									career.</p>

																								<p>Currently, Dicky Beal lives in Independence, KY.</p>

																								<p>Championships require great leaders, and certainly Elder quarterback
																									Rob Florian filled that role for the Panthers. Elder can point to two
																									Ohio Division I state football championships under Florian's guidance.
																									Over the course of his two-year reign, Elder boasted a 28-2 record,
																									two state titles and a Top Ten ranking two straight years in the final
																									USA Today prep poll (9th in 2002, 6th in 2004).</p>

																								<p>Florian was named Division I Player of the Year by The Cincinnati
																									Enquirer, and Greater Cincinnati League-South Player of the Year. Over
																									the course of his two varsity seasons, Florian completed 237 of 447
																									passes (53%) for a staggering 4,366 yards and 44 touchdowns. He also
																									rushed for 1,669 yards and 12 touchdowns.</p>

																								<p>Probably his greatest game was in the 2002 state championship game
																									against Warren Harding in a blinding snowstorm when he almost
																									single-handedly led Elder to the school's first state football title.
																									In the dramatic 21-19 victory, Florian had a hand in all three Panther
																									touchdowns, scoring twice on 27 rushes for 95 yards, and passing for a
																									third TD with a 9-for-24, 165-yard performance. He was named the
																									championship game MVP.</p>

																								<p>Florian played his collegiate career at the University of Dayton
																									where he led the Flyers to the 2007 Division I-AA national
																									championship.</p>

																								<p>Setting records seems to come second nature to Gino Guidugli, who
																									ranks among the finest in a long line of All-State quarterbacks at
																									Highlands High School.</p>

																								<p>Though he had to wait his turn behind another record-setting
																									quarterback in LaRosa's Hall of Famer Jared Lorenzen, Gino proved more
																									than spectacular. He led the Bluebirds to two Class AAA state
																									championships, a 28-2 record during that run and finished the 2000
																									season as the 13th best team in the nation according to USA TODAY.</p>

																								<p>In just two seasons, Guidugli re-wrote all his predecessor's passing
																									records as he passed for 7,516 yards with 92 touchdown passes. Gino's
																									4,367 yards in 2000 was the second-best effort in Kentucky high school
																									history. Upon graduation, his state single season and career records
																									were remarkable: 3rd in completions (260), 3rd in TD passes (53), 5TH
																									in yards per game (291.1), 6th in attempts (404), 8th in completion
																									percentage (.643); career – 8th in passing yards (7,516), 3rd in
																									completion percentage (.621), tied 5th in TDs (92) and 13th in
																									completions (434).</p>

																								<p>He was named first team All-State by the Louisville Courier-Journal
																									and the Lexington Herald. Guidugli was named to the Prep Star and
																									Super Prep All-America teams, and was honorable mention All-America by
																									USA Today. He finished runner-up in balloting for Kentucky's Mr.
																									Football.</p>

																								<p>His penchant for setting football records continued at the University
																									of Cincinnati, where he was named Freshman All-American. He is the
																									Bearcats' all-time career leader in Pass Completions (880), Attempts
																									(1556), Yards Passing (11,453) and Touchdown Passes (78), and holds
																									Single Season records in Attempts, Completions and Passing Yards.</p>

																								<p>Guidugli signed as a free agent with the Tennessee Titans of the NFL,
																									then went on to play five seasons in the Canadian Football League and
																									the Arena Football League.
																									Currently, Guidugli is the running backs' coach with the University of
																									Cincinnati.

																								<p>It takes a special breed of athlete to be inducted into the LaRosa's

																								<p>Mosko is regarded to be one of the two finest swimmers to come out of
																									St. Xavier High School since Olympic gold medalist Joey Hudepohl, who
																									is one of the 17 first ballot Hall of Famers. Mosko was the LaRosa’s
																									High School MVP in 2006-07. </p>

																								<p>During his four-year career, Mosko won eight state championships as
																									the Bombers won four of their nine-straight state titles. He was a
																									high school All-American in eight different events as a senior and his
																									state championship times in the 500-yard Freestyle (4:20.56) and the
																									200-yard Freestyle (1:37.97) were the best National High School times
																									in 2007. His 500 Freestyle time topped both the Ohio state record set
																									in 1999 and the St. X school record set in 1991 by Hudepohl. Overall,
																									Mosko set six records in his career.</p>

																								<p>Mosko, named Cincinnati Enquirer Swimmer of the Year, qualified in
																									three different events for the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials. </p>

																								<p>David Mosko continued his swimming career on scholarship at Stanford
																									University where injuries hampered his career. He earned five varsity
																									letters and was two-time team captain. He won the 2010 PAC 10 500
																									Freestyle (4:14.53). Going into the 2017-18 season, he still stands in
																									Stanford's Top 10 All-Time in the 200 Freestyle (#3, 1:41.92 in 2009),
																									500 Freestyle (#5 :4:13.92 in 2010) and the 1,650 Free (#7 14:45.30 in
																									2009).</p>

																								<p>Currently, David Mosko is a Medical Resident at Christ Hospital.</p>

																								<p>Thompson, named co-LaRosa's Female Athlete of the Year in 2006,
																									earned 15 varsity letters in four sports. Thompson was a part of five
																									state championships and she was First Team All-City in all four
																									sports. She earned four varsity letters each in cross-country, track
																									and soccer and three letters in basketball. Distance running was her
																									strength, winning two Ohio Division II state titles in cross-country
																									(2002 in 18:13) and (2003 in 18:36), one state title in track
																									(3200-meter relay, 9:26.39 in 2005), and two team state titles in
																									cross-country (2002 and 2004).
																								</p>

																								<p>She was undefeated in CHL competition in track. Thompson was The
																									Cincinnati Enquirer's Division II Runner of the Year three times in
																									cross-country and First Team All-City in track four times.</p>

																								<p>An outstanding basketball star as well, Thompson averaged 23 points,
																									11 rebounds, eight steals and 3.2 assists as a senior. She was named
																									Division II Southwest Ohio Coaches Association Player of the Year and
																									Honorable Mention All-State.</p>

																								<p>In soccer – keep in mind that it is played at the same time of the
																									year as cross-country – Thompson was picked to The Enquirer’s First
																									Team All-City in Division II and twice was named a member of the
																									Southwest Ohio Coaches Association All-Star team as well as being a
																									member of the SWOCA's 30-30 Club (30 goals-30 assists).</p>


																								<p>Thompson continued her running career at The Ohio State University. A

                                Marc Edwards may be the last two-way football player to gain national recognition to
                                come out of Cincinnati. The 1992 <em> LaRosa&rsquo;s Male Athlete of the Year</em> (he
                                won as a junior), is unquestionably the finest football player in Norwood High School
                                history, and may be the best to come out of Cincinnati in the last decade. </span></p>
                            <p class="nomineeSubcontentWhite"> Recognized as an <em>ESPN</em> High School All-American,
                              Edwards seldom left the football field. He not only starred at fullback and linebacker,
                              but was also Norwood&rsquo;s place-kicker and punter! </p>
                            <p class="nomineeSubcontentWhite"> His career statistics were amazing. He led the city in
                              rushing three straight seasons, amassing 6,001 yards and scoring 73 touchdowns. He had 535
                              career tackles. </p>
                            <p class="nomineeSubcontentWhite"> As a junior, Marc rushed for 2,074 yards on 259 carries
                              (8.0 yards per carry) and scoring 152 points on 21 touchdowns, 20 PAT kicks and three
                              2-point PATs. On defense, he had 413 tackles, 7 interceptions, 8 fumble recoveries and a
                              36-yard punting average in leading Norwood to its first postseason football appearance in
                              school history. As a senior, he rushed for 1,721 yards and scored 26 touchdowns, while
                              making 122 tackles. </p>
                            <p class="nomineeSubcontentWhite"> His awards included being named Ohio Player of the Year
                              by the Associated Press, Ohio&rsquo;s Mr. Football, Ohio Player of the Year by <em>USA
                                Today</em>; he was named the 10 th Best Player in the Midwest by the <em>Detroit Free
                                Press</em> and was twice named <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer&rsquo;s</em> Player of the
                              Year (1991 and 1992). </p>
                            <p class="nomineeSubcontentWhite"> He went on to attend the University of Notre Dame where
                              he started as a true freshman. He was a college All-American honorable mention as a junior
                              after rushing for a career-high 717 yards and scoring nine touchdowns. Named team captain
                              for the Fighting Irish as a senior, Marc finished his collegiate career with 1,591 yards
                              rushing and 27 touchdowns; he had 46 career receptions for 598 yards and five touchdowns.
                            </p>
                            <p class="nomineeSubcontentWhite"> Edwards is the first player in Norwood High School
                              history to be drafted by the NFL (Second round, 25 th pick, by the San Francisco 49ers in
                              1997). </p>
                            <p class="nomineeSubcontentWhite"> Currently, Marc plays for the Jacksonville Jaguars, where
                              he lives with wife, Darsi, and daughter Taya (5), Ella (3), Livi (born in April). </p>

                                achievement which has not been seen since in Lakota high school sports history. She
                                earned seven varsity letters &ndash; playing four totally dissimilar sports (soccer,
                                basketball, track and softball). </span></p>
                            <p class="nomineeSubcontentWhite"> She won two state championships in track &ndash; setting
                              two state records in the process and established 17 individual school records in
                              basketball, soccer and softball. </p>
                            <p class="nomineeSubcontentWhite"> In track and field, she won the 1979 Ohio shot put
                              championship with an 8-pound shot with a record throw of 46-feet &frac34;-inch; then came
                              back in 1980 with an 8.8-pound shot and set a state record in 44-4&frac12;. Ten weeks
                              before the state meet in 1980, she picked up the discus for the first time and wound up
                              with the Ohio silver medal (138-6), and she anchored the 7 th place finishing 400-meter
                              relay team. </p>
                            <p class="nomineeSubcontentWhite"> Theresa played slow-pitch softball for one season (1979)
                              and set school records with a .671 batting average, 15 home runs and 61 RBI and led the
                              team to a 23-0 season. </p>
                            <p class="nomineeSubcontentWhite"> During the fall, she played soccer and led Lakota in
                              scoring both years. Theresa scored five goals in one game, which still stood as a school
                              record at Lakota when the school district split into two high schools (Lakota West and
                              East). </p>
                            <p class="nomineeSubcontentWhite"> Basketball, however, may have been her best sport. She
                              set 13 school records in two seasons &ndash; three of which stood at the close of the high
                              school (career scoring average, single season and career rebounding average). She scored
                              more than 800 points in her career and had more than 500 rebounds in leading Lakota to a
                              20-3 record and a Top Ten state ranking during the 1979-80 season. She was named First
                              Team All-Ohio, Mid-Miami League Player of the Year, Golden Triangle Player of the Year and
                              starred in the first Ohio High School Basketball Coaches Association All-Star game. </p>

                              Don hit over .300 in his career. A testimony to his excellence was that he was named both

                            <p class="nomineeSubcontentWhite"> In 1956, Don became an assistant basketball coach and
                              head baseball coach at XU where the Musketeers became the first Ohio basketball team to

                              compiled a 53-51 record. </p>

																								<p>The trailblazing 1984 Forest Park girls' basketball was the first
																									girls' basketball team from Cincinnati to win a state championship at
																									any level. Blessed with seniors Nina Fields, Nisey Gordon and Cheryl
																									Lackey, it was juniors Gaby Downey and Alesia Davis who garnered the
																									most recognition. After losing 44-40 to Sycamore in the District
																									finals the previous year, the Lady Chargers came out with a sense of
																									determination the following year. They blew through the regular season
																									– with a close 50-47 victory over Class AAA State semifinalist
																									Columbus Watterson, and a 71-61 victory over eventual Class A state
																									champion, Newark Catholic. On Senior Night, coach Mark Ehlen
																									deliberately scheduled Sycamore for the home finale – and his team
																									responded by jumping out to a 26-4 lead and an eventual 84-45
																									thumping. It set the stage for a district tournament that they won by
																									a margin of 27.5 points. After capturing the regional title, the
																									Chargers faced Mentor Lake Catholic in the state semifinals with a
																									54-29 victory which pit them against Canton McKinley in the state
																									championship game. Interestingly, Ehlen never substituted the entire
																									game as his team never led until the 1:59 point in the game. Forced
																									into overtime, Gaby Downey hit a jumper with 1:50 left to play in OT
																									to cinch a 44-41 victory. Downey, who would be named Tournament MVP,
																									scored 20 points. Downey was named The Cincinnati Enquirer's Player of
																									the Year, while Davis was tabbed first team all-state guard by UPI and
																									second team by the AP. The Chargers finished 13th in the country in
																									the USA Today Super 25.</p>

																								<p>The only Cincinnati Public High School team to win the Ohio Division
																									I state championship, the 1988 Woodward Bulldogs – coached by Larry
																									Miller – dominated opponents throughout most of the season. The
																									Bulldogs certainly put their offensive prowess on display in the state
																									title game against Columbus Linden McKinley when they raced out to a
																									34-13 first quarter lead. Woodward never looked back from that
																									overpowering start in racking up a 107-70 victory. In winning the
																									state title, Woodward also set a school record for most single season
																									wins. The 34 first-quarter points still stand as an Ohio state
																									tournament record for most points scored in a quarter. The final total
																									points scored (107) also stand as a state record. The Bulldogs were
																									led in scoring by D.J. Boston (27 in championship game, 51 in the
																									state tournament), Chip Jones (24) and Orlando Berry, Sr. (17). The
																									team captains included Jones, Troy Long Sr., and Kevin Andrew.
																									Woodward wound up ranked No. 4 in the nation in the final USA TODAY
																									rankings. Both Boston and Jones were selected first team all-Ohio.
																									Most of the players on the team wound up playing college basketball.
																									Boston, who averaged 22.3 points and 12 rebounds, was selected by the
																									Toronto Blue Jays in the major league free agent baseball draft and
																									wound up playing professional baseball. Jones, (23.1 points) enjoyed
																									an outstanding career at the University of Dayton. The team's "sixth
																									man" was Berry who went on to be a starter at the University of
																									Tennessee; Katara Reliford (13.5 points, 6.5 rebounds) went on to
																									start at Butler University; Melvin Bostic (9.8 points, 7 rebounds)
																									started at St. Francis (PA); and, Andrew was a starter at Denison
																									University."These were great kids with a tremendous work ethic,"
																									Miller says. "Our practices were like our toughest games of the year
																									... These were outstanding young men who developed into outstanding
																									men." Miller also puts a lot of credit on his assistant coaches – Jim
																									Leon, the late Dennis Bettis, Dave Hammer, Larry Flinner, Scott Owens
																									and Ed Teubner. Principal Michael Brandt went out and hired Martha
																									Gellar from Procter and Gamble to mentor and tutor the athletes and
																									Athletic Director Tex Meloy also played key roles in Woodward's
																									success. "These two men built this program financially and
																									academically," Miller noted. "It could not have happened without
																									them."</p>

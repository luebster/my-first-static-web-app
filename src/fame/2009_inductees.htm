                                            The Buddy LaRosa high school Sports Hall of Fame was established
                                            in 1975 to recognize outstanding athletes from area high schools.
                                            Each year, nominees are considered based solely upon high school
                                            accomplishments. Collegiate, professional, or other amateur achievements
                                            have no bearing on the selection process. The nominee must have
                                            graduated high school 10 years before eligibility may begin.

                                                  &ndash; which was rare during that time &ndash; Ralph was named both

                                                <p>Perhaps a clearer indication of Richter&rsquo;s basketball prowess

                                                  1,000 points in his career and ranked as UC's No. 2 all-time leading
                                                  scorer. His 460 points scored in 1949 was the first time any UC player
                                                  scored more than 400 and it was never bettered until six years later
                                                  by Jack Twyman. In fact, various reports indicate Richter&rsquo;s 460
                                                  points led the nation in scoring that year and that he was named
                                                  honorable mention All-America. UC posted a 50-12 record during

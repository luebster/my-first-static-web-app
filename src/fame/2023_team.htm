																								<p>Mount Notre Dame High School, and coach Dr. Scott Rogers in
																									particular, have been blessed with great talent and multiple state
																									championships in girls' basketball, but perhaps the finest team he
																									ever coached was the first one – the 2003-04 undefeated Ohio Division
																									I state champions.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									Led by Ohio’s Ms. Basketball and LaRosa’s Hall of Famer, Mel Thomas,
																									the Cougars returned all five starters from the previous year’s team
																									who suffered a heart-breaking loss to the eventual state champion in
																									the regional finals.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									The fervor of the 2003-04 season was cast by that loss. Including
																									Thomas, the top six players returned from the previous season – guard
																									Robyn Shipley, Michelle Jones, Cassie Brannen, Angela Estes and Ali
																									Rohlfs.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									“Our mindset was, ‘This is our last chance. We’re going to win.’,”
																									recalled Thomas. “I remember, even in conditioning before the season,
																									it was always in our minds. It was the ultimate goal. We were going to
																									win. There were no times we felt more confident than other times.”
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									After cruising through most of the season, the Cougars first big test
																									came in the regional championship game again. This time versus
																									Pickerington North, Mount Notre Dame trailed by four points in the
																									final 3:15 before Thomas scored six points in MND’s 12-3 closing run.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									“North was unbelievable,” Rogers said. “We managed to pull the game
																									out late. The confidence level of the kids was at an exponential level
																									from that point on.”
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									Three of the four teams in the Final Four were undefeated with Dayton
																									Chaminade-Julienne favored as the No. 1-ranked team in United States
																									and Ohio.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									MND had a tough battle in the semifinals against Slyvania Northview.
																									After a 14-1 run put Northview on top 45-44 with 3:57 left in the
																									game, Thomas sank a field goal to put the Cougars back on top and then
																									made six free throws in the final 32.9 seconds to hold off the
																									Wildcats.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									The championship finals was supposed to belong to Chaminade. MND has
																									other thoughts. The Cougars led by as many as 17 points in the fourth
																									quarter. Thomas scored 21 points to lead Mount Notre Dame on her way
																									to being named the state tournament’s Most Valuable Player. Lee
																									Stephens added 20 points to also earn a spot on the all-tournament
																									team. MND was subsequently named No. 1 in the country.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									The victory was considered an upset, but not by Dr. Rogers and
																									especially by his team.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									“People said we were underdogs, but not in our minds,” Thomas said. “I
																									don’t think any of us paid attention to the rankings.”

																								<p>Unquestionably the finest football team in Purcell-Marian history
																									(that’s after the merger), the P-M Cavaliers overpowered just about
																									every team it played that season. It was a remarkable accomplishment
																									given that the team was unranked and totally off everyone’s radar and
																									it wound up the city’s No. 1 team, the Ohio Division II state
																									champion, the only undefeated team in Ohio and was regarded No. 4 in
																									the country in USA TODAY’s final poll.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									With no home football stadium, no league affiliation (as it was no
																									longer in the Greater Cincinnati League,) a practice field that was
																									essentially dirt and a coaching staff of four, coach Herb Woeste
																									molded this team into a force that was totally fearsome.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									Led by quarterback John Paul Case, tight end Jay Koch and an
																									overwhelming defense led by nose guard Cliff Pope, Koch at linebacker
																									and strong safety Scott Barnett, the Cavaliers played primarily
																									Division I schedule. It included the eventual Division I state
																									champion Fairfield, along with Moeller, Roger Bacon, Wyoming, Oak
																									Hills, and neighborhood rival Norwood.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									The Cavs finished 14-0, setting five school records along the way --
																									443 points scored, 32 points per game average, 84 points allowed on
																									defense, six points allowed average per game and five shutouts.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									Purcell-Marian’s toughest games of the year came against two of the
																									state’s best clubs in Fairfield and Moeller.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									At a sold-out Fairfield Homecoming game, the Cavaliers sent a 10-10
																									tie at the end of regulations in to two overtimes. Both teams traded
																									TDs in the first OT, then in the second OT Purcell started their
																									series with a seven-yard loss, followed by a six-yard gain. On third
																									down, 235-pound fullback George Riley rumbled 21 yards for a
																									game-winning touchdown – 23-17.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									Two weeks later, Purcell hosted No. 2-ranked Moeller at Norwood
																									Stadium. The only coach in Cincinnati to pick the Cavaliers was
																									Fairfield’s Ben Hubbard. Again, the Purcell defense pushed the game
																									into overtime at 7-7. After holding Moeller to a field goal, Purcell
																									responded with an 11-yard pass from Case to Koch. On the next play,
																									Case dashed the final nine yards on a quarterback draw to cinch the
																									game, 17-10.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									Purcell proceeded to win the regional championship over Lemon-Monroe,
																									37-14, then followed with a 33-10 victory over Wooster in the state
																									semifinals.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									The state title game was against unbeaten Willoughby South (13-0),
																									before more than 30,000 fans at Ohio Stadium. Though South had
																									defeated state powers Cleveland Benedictine and North Canton Hoover
																									earlier in the season, the Cavaliers totally overwhelmed the Rebels,
																									26-7.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									Case had one of his best games of the season, hitting 13-of-20 passes
																									for 195 yards and a touchdown. He kicked a 42-yard field goal which
																									set the state record for longest FG made in a championship game. Pope
																									led a defensive line of Vince Lomboy and Greg Reed as he had 10
																									tackles (8 solo) and two sacks; Reed had nine tackles and Lomboy had
																									two tackles and a sack.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									“We couldn’t go to the pass pocket,” Willoughby South Coach Dan
																									Hoffman said. “Their pass rush was just too strong.”
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									Jay Koch – one of three captains along with Tony Adkins and John
																									Chambers – and was named Cincinnati Enquirer and Cincinnati Post
																									Player of the Year, first-team all-state and Defensive Lineman of the
																									Year. Scott Barnett was a first-team all-state safety as well as
																									first-team all-city by both the Enquirer and Post. Woeste was named
																									the Cincinnati Class AAA Coach of the Year. An amazing 20 of the 22
																									Purcell starters received either first team or honorable mention
																									all-city honors.

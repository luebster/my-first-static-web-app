																								<p>Arguably one of the five best high school football teams in Greater
																									Cincinnati history, the 2004 Colerain football team was a blitzkrieg
																									through the regular season and postseason as well. Led by <i>LaRosa's
																										Hall of Famer and MVP of the Year</i> <b>Dominick Goodman</b>, the
																									Cardinals were the Ohio Division I state champion and finished ranked
																									No. 1 in the nation by <i>MaxPreps</i> and No. 5 by <i>USATODAY</i>.
																									This team was so overpowering that its defense scored more points than
																									it allowed during the course of the season. </p>
																								<p>Coach Kerry Coombs truly believes the groundwork was laid in 2003
																									when the Cardinals suffered a 24-23 loss to Elder in the Regional
																									Championship. Elder went on to win the state title. "I think that
																									disappointment motivated the team all the way through the next year
																									culminating with a State Championship," Coombs said. "I believe what
																									made the 2004 team different from other teams … These guys played
																									basketball together, worked out together, hung out together from the
																									time they were 11 years old until their last game together in Canton.
																									They knew each other better than anyone else, and more importantly,
																									they truly loved each other."</p>
																								<p>After an inauspicious start in the state title game that saw Colerain
																									lose three fumbles within its own territory and falling behind
																									13th-ranked Canton McKinley, 10-6, the Cardinals put on a
																									record-setting show with a 50-10 victory over the Bulldogs. It was the
																									most points scored and the largest margin of victory in the big-school
																									title game, and senior quarterback Goodman rushed for a division
																									record 259 yards and four touchdowns. Colerain, which outscored its
																									five tournament opponents, 191-22, set a division state finals record
																									with 463 yards rushing and held McKinley to 127 total yards. </p>
																								<p>In addition to Goodman, other key players on this squad included
																									<i>LaRosa's 2005-06 MVP of the Year</i> in offensive lineman <b>Conner
																										Smith (Ohio State)</b>, defensive lineman and LaRosa's Hall of Famer
																									<b>Terrill Byrd</b> (Cincinnati) and brother <b>Tirrdell</b>, free
																									safety <b>Eugene Clifford</b> (Ohio State), running backs <b>Mister
																										Simpson</b> (Michigan) and <b>Terrence Sherrer</b> (Minnesota), and
																									linebackers <b>Andre Revels</b> (Cincinnati) and <b>Cobrani Mixon</b>
																									(Kent State). This team set school records in: Most Points
																									Scored/Season (504), Most Extra Points (<b>Brad Schutte</b> 62), Yards
																									Per Carry (Sherrer, 11.8), Career TDs (Simpson 40) and Career Points
																									(Simpson 240).

																								<p>The script could have been called "Hoosiers", but since this took
																									place in Kentucky, the "We Are Family" Villa Madonna team wrote their
																									own title - a championship title! The 1980 volleyball team clearly fit
																									the bill as the "little" school in the "big" school matchup in the
																									fall of 1980 – only the second state volleyball tournament in Kentucky
																									history. With an enrollment of only 158 girls, Villa Madonna Academy
																									came away with the Kentucky state championship – crushing Our Lady of
																									Providence, 15-4, 15-1. The Kentucky state volleyball tournament is
																									not broken into divisions, so an overall state title meant defeating
																									notable schools out of Louisville and Lexington.</p>
																								<p>This Villa Madonna squad featured four eventual Division I college
																									athletes. Both <b>Lori Erpenbeck</b> and <b>Fredda Simpson</b> went to
																									the University of Kentucky, <b>Lisa Warman</b> to Florida State
																									University and <b>Stephanie Scheper</b> (University of Tennessee).
																									Cousin Jane Scheper wound up at Thomas More College. One of the teams'
																									two losses came at the hands of Mother of Mercy's team, which went on
																									to win the Ohio Class AAA state title (coached by LaRosa's Hall of
																									Famer, Rose Bauer Koch). Interestingly, team captain <b>"Freddie"
																										Simpson</b> starred in the movie <i>A League of Their Own</i> as
																									Ellen Sue, the beauty queen and shortstop.</p>
																								<p>"As a coach, one could only dream of a team willing to learn the game
																									of volleyball, to have athletic talent, determination and the
																									intelligence to understand all the different aspects of the game
																									necessary to be successful," head coach Carla Austin said. "The team
																									members always gave 110% at each practice and game," she continued.
																									"They all believed in the journey we were on, to work hard, to get
																									along, and believe we could achieve the goals we set. This was without
																									a doubt a dream team."</p>

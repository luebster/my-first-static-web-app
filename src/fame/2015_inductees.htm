																								<p>In the storied history of St. Xavier swimming, Jayme Cramer easily
																									ranks among the top three swimmers to ever compete for the hallowed
																									program. Cramer won 10 state swimming titles during his career - five
																									individual and five as a member of a relay team. During his four-year
																									career, St. Xavier won three state titles, including the national
																									title in 2001. His senior season was so remarkable, he was named the
																									national High School Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World Magazine.
																									His times in the 100 Butterfly, 100 Backstroke, 200 and 400 Medley
																									Relays ranked No. 1 in the nation that year.</p>

																								<p>Among the four state titles he won in 2001, his performance in the
																									100-yard backstroke ranks among the best in national high school
																									history. Cramer turned in a blistering 47.65 time in the event - which
																									at the time was only .15 second off the national prep record. His time
																									still stands as an Ohio state and Canton Natatorium pool record! It
																									was the third straight year he set state and pool records in that
																									event.</p>

																								<p>Jayme also has the distinction of being the lead member of the 2000
																									200-Yard Medley Relay team which shattered the state mark at 1:31.22 -
																									and that record still ranks as the Ohio state standard.</p>

																								<p>He was named High School All-American 22 times during this career. He
																									was the Ohio Male Swimmer of the Year in both 2000 and 2001 and The
																									Cincinnati Enquirer's Swimmer of the Year in 2000.</p>

																								<p>Cramer's collegiate career at Stanford was equally stellar. He won
																									two NCAA national titles - 200-Meter in 2004 and the 400-Yard Medley
																									Relay in 2005. As a 20-time NCAA All-American, Cramer set three
																									Stanford relay records and broke multiple Pac-10 meet and conference
																									marks. He was the Stanford team captain from 2003-2005.</p>

																								<p>As an amateur, Cramer won the Gold Medal in the World Championship in
																									the 800 Free Relay in both 2005 and 2007. He won a Gold and Bronze
																									Medal in the 2003 Pan Am Games. He competed in the 2000, 2004 and 2008
																									U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials.</p>

																								<p>Currently, Cramer and his wife, Kate, live in Baton Rouge, LA, where
																									he is CFO/COO and head coach of Crawfish Aquatics. They have three
																									children, Lucy Grace, Molly and Leland.</p>

																								<p>You have to be a pretty special athlete to be a four-year letterman
																									in three different sports in high school, and Rodney Geier clearly fit
																									that description during his storied career at Cincinnati Country Day
																									School.</p>

																								<p>A star in football, basketball and tennis, Geier was among the city's
																									best during his career. As a senior, the running back lead the Indians
																									to their second-straight 9-0 record and a No. 7 ranking in the state
																									in Class A. Geier led the state in points scored that season, scoring
																									216 points with 31 touchdowns. In fact, he scored six touchdowns in
																									one game that year and five touchdowns in two others. He rushed for
																									1,891 yards in 219 carries for a remarkable 8.6 yards-per-carry.</p>

																								<p>A first team all-city selection by The Cincinnati Enquirer, Geier was
																									also featured that season in Sports Illustrated’s "Faces in the
																									Crowd." His athletic prowess continued in basketball as he was the
																									city's third-leading scorer as a senior and was 7th in the city as a
																									junior. </p>

																								<p>In tennis, he teamed up with Addison Lanier to win the Ohio Class A
																									state doubles title in 1971. Geier was inducted into the CCD Hall of
																									Fame as part of the inaugural class in 2002.</p>

																								<p>Geier continued his football career at Williams College in
																									Massachusetts, where he was the starting tailback in 1973 and 1974.
																								</p>

																								<p>He went on to study at the University of Cincinnati's College of
																									Medicine, and graduated in 1988 from the UC Department of Radiation
																									Oncology. He has been listed among Cincinnati Magazine's "Top Doctors"
																									numerous times over the years.</p>

																								<p>Currently, Dr. Rodney Geier practices medicine as a Radiation
																									Oncologist with Oncology Hematology Care in Cincinnati. He and his
																									wife, Vallie Comisar Geier, have three children, Dr. Natalie Geier
																									(Cohen), Emily Vollmer and Vallie Tapke, and three grandchildren.</p>

																								<p>Lorenzen was also an accomplished basketball player for Highlands as
																									well. He was a member of the Bluebirds' 1997 Sweet Sixteen runner-up

																									guard led Mount Notre Dame to a perfect 28-0 record and the Ohio
																									Division I state title in 2004. Thomas average 20.4 points, 4 rebounds

																									were ranked No. 2 by USA TODAY. MND was 76-24 during her four seasons.

																								<p>No coach in any sport in the history of Ohio high school sports has
																									accomplished in their career what St. Xavier swimming coach Jim Brower
																									has done. In 23 years as the Aquabombers head coach, Brower won an
																									amazing 21 state championships. The swimming dynasty of St. Xavier has
																									been long established, yet Brower's contribution has been clearly
																									undeniable. St. Xavier has won 36 overall state swimming titles -
																									Brower's 21 crowns account for more than 58%. He has enjoyed winning
																									streaks of five, seven and nine straight titles. When he retired in
																									June of 2015, the Aquabombers had won 15 of the last 16 state swimming
																									championships.</p>

																								<p>Coach Brower was named the National High School Coaches Association's
																									Coach of the Year in 2004. He has been named Ohio Coach of the Year
																									seven times and has been accorded the same honor by The Cincinnati
																									Enquirer, Cincinnati Post, the Southwest District and the Greater
																									Cincinnati League multiple times.</p>

																								<p>During Brower's career, his swim team has been acknowledged by
																									Swimming World Magazine as the national champions in both 1992 and
																									2001. In both cases, the Aquabombers featured perhaps their two
																									greatest swimmers in LaRosa's Hall of Fame inductees Joey Hudepohl
																									(1992) and Jayme Cramer (2001). Hudepohl went on to win an Olympic
																									Gold Medal, while Cramer won two NCAA Championships.</p>

																								<p>Brower was a state champion in his own right as well, having won the
																									100-yard breaststroke at the Ohio state meet in 1982 as a member of
																									the Canton Glenoak team. He went on to swim at the University of
																									Cincinnati. </p>

																								<p>Currently, Jim Brower still teaches in the math department at St.
																									Xavier High School, where he has worked for more than 25 years.</p>

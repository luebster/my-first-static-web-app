																								<p>The most feared defensive lineman anchoring the middle of one of the

																									playoffs, Terrill Byrd intimidated foes throughout his career. As a
																									senior, Byrd recorded a staggering 63 team tackles and set a school
																									record for 37 tackles-for-losses. In doing so, he was honored as the
																									National Defensive Player of the Year by PrepNation.com in 2005.</p>
																								<p>Terrill symbolized a defense on a 15-0 Colerain team that in 2004
																									allowed only 98 points all year, including six shutouts. In 15 games,
																									the Ohio Division I state champions allowed only a strangling 1,921
																									total yards (742 rushing) and eight rushing touchdowns.</p>
																								<p>Terrill accumulated numerous other accolades during his career
																									including being named first team all-Ohio, The Cincinnati
																									Enquirer/Channel 9 Player of the Year, first team all-city by The
																									Cincinnati Enquirer and was named Defensive Player of the Year in the
																									Greater Miami Conference. </p>
																								<p>The Cardinals were 36-3 when Terrill was a starter. He was featured
																									in Sports Illustrated's Faces in the Crowd and he went on to play in
																									the Big 33 Ohio vs. Pennsylvania All-Star game.</p>
																								<p>His fearsome presence continued in college at the University of
																									Cincinnati where he started four seasons – being named Defensive
																									Newcomer of the Year in the Big East. Terrill was a two-time Big East
																									first team selection and in 2007 was an Associated Press All-American.
																									He went on to play in the Arena Football League.</p>

																								<p>It is hard to think of swimming as more than just an individual
																									sport, but St. Xavier's reign of Ohio swimming championships may have
																									been in jeopardy if not for the "team” play of Kyle Ransom.</p>
																								<p>During his career at St. Xavier, Ransom won seven Ohio state titles –
																									six of them as part of a relay team. And during that four-year run,
																									the Aquabombers won four straight Ohio state titles and the National
																									Championship in 2001. Named a high school All-American 13 times during
																									his career, Kyle finished his senior season with a state championship
																									in the 200-yard individual medley (1:50.70), and anchored both state
																									championship 200-yard freestyle relay (1:24.53) and the 400-yard
																									freestyle relay (3:05.39) teams. He earned numerous awards and
																									accolades over the course of his prep career. In addition to winning
																									seven state titles, he held three St. Xavier team records, and was
																									named Swimmer of the Year in 2003 by The Cincinnati Enquirer.</p>
																								<p>Kyle continued his outstanding career in swimming at Stanford
																									University, where he was a three-time collegiate All-American. While
																									at Stanford, his team won the Pac-10 conference four times and he was
																									a two-time Pac-10 conference champion in the 200-yard free relay (2006
																									and 2007). Kyle won a bronze medal for Team USA as a member of the
																									400-yard free relay team at the World University Games (2005). Kyle
																									was an Olympic Trials Qualifier in 2004, 2008 and 2012, most recently
																									competing in both the 50 and 100 freestyle.</p>
																								<p>Currently, Kyle Ransom works at Deloitte Consulting as a Manager of
																									Supply Chain in Chicago, IL. He and his wife, Ashley, have two
																									daughters (Charlotte and Audrey).</p>

																								<p>Gunning charted new territory in just 12 years of coaching that

																									drove the Pandas to three Kentucky state championships and four second

																									In three of those losses, the Pandas lost to the No. 1-ranked team in
																									the United States. </p>
																								<p>In her 12-year coaching reign, NDA compiled a 360-75 record (83%).
																									Just as remarkable – her teams were District champions, Regional
																									Champions and Northern Kentucky Athletic Conference Champions all 12
																									years!</p>
																								<p>She was named Kentucky Post Coach of the Year seven times, The
																									Kentucky Enquirer Coach of the Year eight times, the Kentucky
																									Volleyball Coaches Association Coach of the Year three times and the
																									National Federation Interscholastic Coaches Association Outstanding
																									Coach for the state of Kentucky in 1993.</p>
																								<p>In 2016, Gunning, Athletic Director at Notre Dame Academy for 20
																									years, received the Brigid DeVires Outstanding Leadership award, from
																									the Kentucky High School Athletic Association which is emblematic of
																									the state's top administrator.</p>
																								<p>During her tenure at NDA, the school also added four sports programs
																									(lacrosse, bowling, bass fishing and archery) and added a gym and
																									three outdoor sports facilities (soccer field and track complex,
																									tennis courts and softball field). Currently, Kim is the assistant
																									athletic director at St. Ursula Academy.</p>

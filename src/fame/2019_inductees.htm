																									graduate, Amber was regarded by The Cincinnati Enquirer as one of the
																									top 50 best female basketball players in Greater Cincinnati history.
																									She was also a heroic athlete who overcame life-threatening odds. A
																									dynamic basketball player for the Firebirds, Amber set 11 school
																									records, including career points scored with 1,931, and would help
																									power Lakota West to the Ohio state runner-up finish in the 2007-08
																									season. The team compiled a 49-5 record during her final two seasons.
																									She was named Ohio Ms. Basketball (2008), McDonald's All-American,
																									Parade Magazine All-American, Nike-WBCA All-American and USA TODAY
																									All-American (Third Team). She was twice named Cincinnati Enquirer and
																									the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Women's Sports Association

																									University of Tennessee, Amber was recovering from surgery to repair
																									her rotator cuff when her lungs filled with fluid and she suffered a

																									aneurysm. She survived a potential life-threatening surgery and later
																									transferred to play basketball at Xavier University, where she played
																									from 2010-12. Amber, who also played volleyball at Lakota West, is the

																								<p>It's always a special moment when you surpass a high school record
																									and it may have been even more so for Katie Schwegmann when she set
																									Bishop Brossart's all-time scoring record - previously held by her
																									father, Greg! That was just one of many accomplishments in one of the
																									truly great high school basketball careers in Northern Kentucky. Katie
																									was named the 2000-01 LaRosa's Female Athlete of the Year and is
																									regarded by The Cincinnati Enquirer as one of the top 50 best female
																									basketball players in Greater Cincinnati history. All of that may have
																									seemed unlikely when between her junior and senior years, she suffered
																									what appeared to be a career-ending knee injury over the summer.
																									Heaped with a multitude of awards as a junior - including being
																									selected as a one of six finalists for LaRosa's Athlete of the Year --
																									Katie topped those accomplishments as a senior, when
																									she was named Kentucky's Ms. Basketball, emblematic of the best player
																									in the state. It was the crowning achievement after a season that saw
																									her named Louisville Courier-Journal Kentucky Player of the Year,
																									winner of the Joe Billy Mansfield Award and Gatorade's Kentucky Player
																									of the Year. She scored 2,917 career points and was named 1st team
																									All-Northern Kentucky five times, Northern Kentucky Player of the Year
																									three times by both Kentucky Post and the Cincinnati Enquirer and
																									earned 1st team all-state honors three times. As a sophomore she led
																									Brossart to its first Class A state title, where she was named
																									tournament MVP. She holds numerous other school records, including
																									single-season scoring and single-game scoring.</p>

																								<p>In addition to basketball, Katie ran cross-country and track where
																									she won three state titles and was named Northern Kentucky Runner of
																									the Year as a sophomore. In track, Katie won a state title in track
																									twice as a member of 3200-meter relay team and captured the 800-meter
																									run as a sophomore. She was all-state three times and the team won
																									three state titles during her career. Her time in the mile run (5:23)
																									still stands at the Bishop Brossart school record. In cross-country,
																									she finished third in the state in 1996 in Class A and was fourth in
																									the state in 1997. She was named first team all-state four times and
																									twice named first team all-Northern Kentucky. She was the team's top
																									runner 53 times and had 18 first-place finishes. The team was a state
																									qualifier four straight times - for the first time in school history.
																									Katie went on to play basketball at Miami University but unfortunately
																									suffered multiple knee injuries as a freshman, forcing her to take a
																									medical hardship. She remained a member of the team for four seasons
																									as "student coach." Currently, Kate Schwegmann Steffen and her husband
																									Randy live in Bellevue, where she is a Certified Integrated Manual
																									Therapist for OrthoCincy in Edgewood, KY. The couple is expecting
																									their first child before the end of the year.</p>

																									(Class of 1971) was named first team all-state in both football and

																									baseball. Bill was a consummate team player as he helped power the

																									The 1970-71 basketball team went 30-4 with three of the four losses to

																									reception records, including most receptions in a game (14) - a mark
																									that stood for more than 25 years. He was named first team all-state
																									as a senior, hauling in 41 passes and scoring seven touchdowns. He

																								<p>The former star athlete at Boone County High School in the early

																									duties of the Covington Catholic High School football program. A
																									struggling program in the eight years prior to Ray's appearance, there
																									was even talk that the all-boys school would do away with football all
																									together.</p>

																								<p>By the end of the 1980s, Covington Catholic football owed its legacy
																									to one man - Lynn Ray. Over the course of his 30-year career at the
																									helm of the Colonels' program, Lynn Ray amassed a 234-132 record, five
																									Class AAA state titles and eight AAA regional championships. His
																									career record is so significant, consider that in the little over 600
																									total games played in CovCath history - Lynn Ray has coached 60% of
																									those game; of the more the 375 school victories - Lynn Ray accounts
																									for nearly 60% of those wins. His total victories rank in the Top 20
																									all-time in the state of Kentucky and No. 3 all-time in Northern
																									Kentucky. The Colonels' five state titles were accomplished in the
																									teeth of the toughest competition in the state in cross-town rival,
																									Highlands. Between CovCath and Highlands from 1987 through 2000, those
																									two schools won the Kentucky state Class AAA title 11 of 14 times. Ray
																									won his first state title in 1987 when the Colonels, trailing, 6-2, at
																									halftime, came back and scored 14 unanswered points to defeat Paducah
																									Tilghman, 16-6. They did it again the following year, when - trailing
																									Paducah, 17-3, at halftime, CovCath came back to score 21 points in
																									the fourth quarter to force an overtime victory, 30-24. Coach Ray, who
																									was President of the Kentucky High School Football Coaches Association
																									in 1994-95, went on to collect numerous honors over the course of his
																									career including being named head coach of the Kentucky All-Stars vs.
																									Tennessee (1990), Kentucky State Coach of the Year (1992), Regional
																									Winner of the National Coach of the Year (1996), and Lifetime
																									Achievement Award from the College Football Hall of Fame (2005). Ray
																									has been inducted into the Covington Catholic Hall of Fame and the
																									Northern Kentucky Hall of Fame. He is retired and living with his

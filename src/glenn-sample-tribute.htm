                                          <p>To some, Glenn Sample was the University of Cincinnati baseball coach and
                                            athletics administrator. To others, he was the magician. For others, he was
                                            the wrestling official. For many, he was the Cincinnati Reds' official
                                            scorer.</p>

                                            everyone who knew Glenn, he was one thing in particular &ndash; the
                                            consummate gentleman.</p>
                                          <p>We at LaRosa's have lost a special friend in Glenn Sample, who passed away
                                            suddenly a week before the 2008 Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
                                          <p>That word &ndash; &quot;gentleman&quot; &ndash; comes up consistently
                                            whenever anyone talks about Glenn Sample. Always dapper, always pleasant,
                                            Glenn always had a kind word to say, a genuine interest in your family, a
                                            smile for every situation.</p>
                                          <p>Glenn was the last continuous member to serve on our Hall of Fame Committee
                                            &ndash; a position he thoroughly enjoyed for 34 years. He was a significant
                                            presence on our board. He was a Hall of Fame inductee himself in 1981 and
                                            never failed to attend the Hall of Fame Banquet ceremony each year.</p>
                                          <p>He argued his points gently and everyone listened. Having played high
                                            school sports at Western Hills, having coached at UC, and having officiated
                                            high school wrestling, Glenn kept a finger on the prep pulse for more than
                                            60 years.<br>
                                            Such insight into individuals for consideration will be keenly missed and
                                            impossible to replace. Glenn had a direct hand in helping induct many
                                            members of our Hall of Fame.<img src="/images/glen-sample1.jpg"

                                          <p>Glenn was truly an icon on the West Side of Cincinnati. He emceed or hosted
                                            countless fundraisers for elementary and high schools throughout Cincinnati
                                            for decades. He would dazzle children and adults alike with his magic
                                            tricks. He kept a smile on people&rsquo;s faces with his stories and his own
                                            warm personality.</p>
                                          <p>He was a giving man. A true gentleman in every sense of the word.</p>
                                          Glenn Sample with be sorely missed not just by us at LaRosa's, but the Greater
                                          Cincinnati community as well.

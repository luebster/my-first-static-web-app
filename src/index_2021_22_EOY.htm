																						For four years, Chance Gray was one of Greater Cincinnati's elite varsity
																						basketball players, a McDonald's All-American, who scored 2,237 points in
																						her impressive career, which ranks her 21st on the Ohio High School Athletic
																						Association's all-time scoring list.
																						<br><br>
																						Following three all-star years at Lakota West, Chance joined the Winton
																						Woods team for her senior season and promptly helped turn the fortunes of
																						the team around, leading the team to a 25-2 record and an ECC championship
																						and district championship, the first such titles in over a decade.

																						<br><br>
																						Winton Woods had won only six games the previous year, but won 25 games with
																						Chance leading the team. She led the ECC in scoring, averaging 26.7 points
																						per game and was second in the league in assists with 3.5 per game.
																						<br><br>
																						Among numerous other honors, she was named ECC Offensive Player of the Year,
																						District 16 Player of the Year and Gatorade Ohio Player of the Year. She was
																						selected to play for the Ohio squad in the Ohio-Kentucky all-star game; she
																						led her Ohio team to victory, scoring a team-leading 20 points and was named
																						MVP of the game.
																						<br><br>
																						Chance Gray has distinguished athletic bloodlines. Chance's father, Carlton
																						Gray, is a LaRosa's Hall of Famer who starred in football at the old Forest
																						Park High School and at UCLA and was a second-round pick of the Seattle
																						Seahawks. Carlton is now the varsity head girls' basketball coach at Winton
																						Woods, where Chance's older sister, Amber Gray, is an assistant coach in the
																						program. Amber, a former high school basketball All-American, is also an
																						inductee into the LaRosa's High School Sports Hall of Fame.
																						<br><br>
																						Chance is active in community service while carrying a 4.0 GPA. She also
																						plays for the Sports City U club basketball club team and will play
																						collegiately beginning next season at the University of Oregon.
																						<br><br>
																						Says her head coach and father Carlton Grey: "Chance is a tireless worker
																						who is self-driven when it comes to improvement of her game every year. She
																						is a very humble kid that is always focused on doing what the team needs."
																						<br><br>

																						When you score more points in your high school basketball career than LeBron
																						James did during his high school career, that's saying something.


																						<br><br>
																						But that is exactly what Woodward senior point guard Paul McMillan IV did in
																						a magical moment during this year's Ohio Div. II regional semifinals'
																						basketball tournament. In the game, Woodward beat Roger Bacon and Paul
																						McMillan scored 23 points to move past LeBron James for sixth place on the
																						Ohio High School all-time scoring list.

																						<br><br>
																						Paul McMillan IV has been a basketball superstar in this area for quite some
																						time and scored an impressive 2,568 points in his great high school career.
																						He is the all-time leading scorer in Cincinnati Public School history and is
																						now the 6th-ranked all-time leading scorer in Ohio high school history.
																						<br><br>
																						McMillan had a good senior season, once again leading the CMAC in scoring,
																						averaging 27.3 points a game, helping his Bulldog team to an undefeated 12-0
																						record in league play, 23-4 over all. He also averaged 4.6 rebounds per
																						game, 5.2 assists per game (which was fourth in the CMAC), 2.2 steals per
																						game and his 57.9% field goal percentage was also fourth in the CMAC. The
																						Bulldogs were CMAC champions, district champions and regional runners-up.
																						Big games for Paul included scoring a school-record 41 points vs. Warren
																						Central, 40 points vs. Dohn Prep, 35 points vs. Hughes and 33 points vs.
																						Toledo Scott.
																						<br><br>
																						His awards and honors would overflow a trophy case. This past season alone,
																						he was named Ohio Gatorade Player of the Year, Ohio Div. II Co-Player of the
																						Year, Southwest Ohio Division II Player of the Year, plus he is a two-time
																						First Team All-Ohio Div. II selection and was a three-time Cincinnati Metro
																						Athletic Conference Player of the Year selection. He holds numerous school
																						records, including three-pointers made in a game (8), points in a season
																						(714) and field goals made in a season (243)
																						<br><br>
																						A great student (4.0 GPA) who is active in community service, Paul has been
																						heavily recruited by big-time college programs, but has committed to study
																						and play basketball at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
																						<br><br>
																						His varsity basketball coach Jarelle Redden says of Paul McMillan IV:
																						"Paul's work ethic on and off the court is phenomenal. His passion and
																						dedication are unmatched. He's a winner and a leader by example."
																						<br><br>

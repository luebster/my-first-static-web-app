																						Lakota West senior Kailyn Dudukovich is a soccer high school All-American,
																						an international champion, an Ohio state champion and a player that the
																						Girls' Soccer Network called one of the top five high school soccer players
																						in the nation in the 2021 class, while Top Drawer Soccer rated her as the #3
																						soccer forward in the nation in the 2021 class.
																						<br><br>
																						During the Firebirds' high school season-to-remember her junior year, Kailyn
																						had one of the greatest high school seasons ever, helping her team to a
																						22-0-2 record and an Ohio state championship. Kailyn came through in the
																						clutch with two goals in the state championship game, including the
																						game-winner with 13 seconds to go, to secure a 2-1 victory over Anthony
																						Wayne. She scored a remarkable 50 goals during the season, a Lakota and GMC
																						single-season record. She also chipped in nine assists, so for the year, she
																						accounted for 109 points, also a school and conference record. She holds at
																						least a half dozen other records. Her senior season, Kaylyn helped lead her
																						team to the regional semi-finals, scoring all three of her team's goals in
																						the semi-final game to secure the 3-2 victory over Mount Notre Dame. She
																						once again led the league in goals (46) and points (99). She managed to
																						break all existing scoring and point total records for the Lakota School
																						District with a two-year total of 96 goals and 208 points.

																						<br><br>
																						Kailyn has won numerous honors for her stellar play. During her exceptional
																						varsity career, she was twice named a soccer All-American. She was the
																						recipient of the Ms. Ohio Soccer and Gatorade Ohio Soccer Player of the Year
																						awards, and two times she was named Ohio Div. I Soccer Player of the Year,
																						SWO District Player of the Year, GMC Player of the Year and 1st team
																						all-state. She was also named by the Cincinnati.com Sports Awards' her
																						junior year as Cincinnati Soccer Player of the Year as well as the girls'
																						overall Athlete of the Year. Kailyn will play her soccer collegiately at the
																						Ohio State University.
																						<br><br>
																						A super student (4.76 GPA) and member of National Honor Society, she is very
																						active in
																						community service and also plays for the Ohio Elite soccer club. She was
																						also an all-star basketball player for the Firebirds.

																					<div style="font-size: 11px;">
																						In his incredible varsity career, good things started early on for Roger
																						Bacon's Corey Kiner, one of the best high school running backs in the nation
																						in the class of 2021. As a freshman, in just his second varsity game, Corey
																						set a new school single-game rushing record, running for 302 yards and five
																						touchdowns in a 47-12 win against Western Hills. He finished the season
																						rushing for 1,226 yards and 15 touchdowns ... and he was just beginning.


																						<br><br>
																						For the next three years, Corey kept on running and setting records (11
																						school records) and was one of the most sought-after college recruits in
																						Greater Cincinnati. He was on Sports Illustrated's preseason high school
																						All-American watch list. His numbers are staggering: his 7,130 career
																						rushing yards ranks him tenth in Ohio history; his 116 rushing touchdowns is
																						third in Ohio history, and his 125 total TDs and his 772 points scored are
																						both third in Ohio history.
																						During his varsity career, he amassed an astounding 8,937 all-purpose yards.


																						<br><br>
																						Cory has won an entire trophy case full of awards, including his senior year
																						when he was named Ohio Mr. Football, Gatorade Ohio Player of the Year,
																						Southwest Ohio District Div. V Offensive Player of the Year, Cincinnati Div.
																						V-VI Offensive Player of the Year and second team All-American by MaxPreps.
																						Corey is only the third player from Cincinnati to win the Mr. Football award
																						since its inception in 1987.
																						<br><br>
																						An honor roll student who is very active in community service, Corey also
																						ran track for the
																						Spartans. During his free time, he enjoys drawing, graphic design, fishing,
																						traveling with his
																						family and attending sporting events at Roger Bacon. He will play football
																						collegiately at LSU.

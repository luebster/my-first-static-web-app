																						One of Cincinnati's most outstanding two-sport athletes is Wyoming High
																						School's <b>Evan Prater</b>, a superstar in both football and basketball.


																						<br><br>
																						A football dual-threat quarterback, Evan since his sophomore year was
																						entrusted to lead a Wyoming Cowboys' program that is the winningest high
																						school football program in Cincinnati history. The Cowboys haven't lost a
																						league football game in four years. With Prater at quarterback, Wyoming went
																						40-2 in his three years as a starter. Prater never lost a regular season
																						game in his varsity career.

																						<br><br>
																						His junior year, Evan led Wyoming to a 15-0 season record and the Ohio state
																						championship in Division IV, capping off the season with a five-touchdown
																						performance in the Cowboys' 42-14 win over Girard in the state final game.
																						<br><br>
																						Evan Prater finished his football career with incredible numbers, He
																						completed his high school career by throwing for 5,699 yards and 72
																						touchdowns and rushing for 4,124 yards and 73 touchdowns.
																						<br><br>
																						For his outstanding accomplishments, Prater was named Ohio Mr. Football,
																						marking the first time a player from Cincinnati has won that prestigious
																						award in the past 27 years. He also was named MaxPreps' Ohio Athlete of the
																						Year, Ohio Div. IV Player of the Year for the second time, Ohio Div. IV
																						Co-Offensive Player of the Year, Southwest Ohio District Co-Offensive Player
																						of the Year, USA Today Ohio Offensive Player of the Year and Cincinnati
																						Enquirer Div. IV Offensive Player of the Year. He was selected to play in
																						the 2020 U.S. All-American Game, and was named to the Cincinnati Div.
																						III-VII All-Decade Team. The Cincinnati.com Sports Awards named Evan Small
																						School Football Player of the Year as well as over all Boys' Athlete of the
																						Year.
																						<br><br>
																						In basketball, his senior year, Evan led the Cowboys to a 24-1 over all
																						record and an undefeated 13-0 record in the CHL. Evan's Cowboy teams didn't
																						lose a league basketball game in two years. His senior year, Evan averaged
																						19.4 points-6.7 rebounds per game, winning a sixth CHL title in seven years,
																						and Evan was named 1st team all-CHL, 1st team all-city Div. II (Enquirer)
																						and 1st team all-SWO District Div. II. He scored more than a thousand points
																						in his great varsity basketball career.
																						<br><br>
																						Heavily recruited, Evan will stay close at home to play his college football
																						at the University of Cincinnati.
																						<br><br>

                                          may only be won once during a High School student's career. The
                                          winners are judged solely on their performance during the previous
                                          academic year. <br>

                                          Each year, nominees are considered based solely upon High School
                                          accomplishments. Collegiate, professional, or other amateur achievements
                                          have no bearing on the selection process. The nominee must have
                                          graduated High School 10 years before eligibility may begin. <br> <br>
                                          A maximum of 5 athletes are inducted into the Hall of Fame each

                                          and scored a record-tieing four touchdowns. For that performance
                                          he was named USA Today's High School Football Player of the Week.
                                          He was also named as a football All-American by PrepNation.com

                                          play football next season for the University of Cincinnati. Also
                                          a stellar basketball player, Dominick became the first player in
